WARNING:

Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* PHP 5.5 is no more supported. Minimum PHP is now 5.6+.
* Default mode for GETPOST function is now 'alphanohtml' instead of 'none'. So check when you make POST or GET requests with
  HTML content that you make a GETPOST('myparam', 'restricthtml') or GETPOST('myparam', 'none') if you really need posted content without sanitizing
  the HTML code of content (in such a case, sanitize data later)
* Removed hidden constant MAIN_EXTRAFIELDS_IN_ONE_TD that was useless. 
* Reference of object including a "/" are no more allowed. It is never used by default but to support setup that introduced it, the "/" will be replaced 
  by a "_" automatically when a reference (with a custom numbering mask that use it) is generated.  
* Library jflot (replace with chartjs) was removed.
* Library geoip (replaced with geoip2) was removed.  
* Hidden constant COMMANDE_VALID_AFTER_CLOSE_PROPAL was renamed into ORDER_VALID_AFTER_CLOSE_PROPAL.
* Object field ref_int is deprecated and set to 'not used', method to fetch object by only ref_int is not supported anymore.
* UserGroup class has been refactored with new architecture. Triggers of class UserGroup are now USERGROUP_CREATE, USERGROUP_MODIFY, USERGROUP_DELETE
* A new way to navigate between pages in list is available. To use it (not mandatory), you must:
  - replace line $page = GETPOST('page', 'int') with $page = GETPOSTISSET('pageplusone') ? (GETPOST('pageplusone') - 1) : GETPOST("page", 'int'); 
  - remove input field in form '<input type="hidden" name="page" value="'.$page.'">';'
  - add parameter $pagenavastextinput to value 1 when calling print_barre_liste()

WARNING FOR DOLIWAMP USERS ONLY:

Only people that installed Dolibarr using the all-in-one autoinstaller for Windows called "DoliWAMP" are concerned by the following warnings:
 
* DoliWAMP autoinstaller for Windows is not more available on 32bits systems. Use standard package if you need to use such architecture.
* It is not possible to migrate from an installation done with the old DoliWAMP autoinstaller for Windows by using this new one. You must make a backup 
  of your database, make a fresh installation using the new installer and reload.
* Don't forget that DoliWAMP is a good solution to make a quick test of Dolibarr on your local computer but was never recommanded as a production
  solution on a local desktop since a desktop computer has not a backup and security policy as good as on a server (when there is one). 
  DoliWAMP remains a solution for fast test or demo purposes.

***** ChangeLog for 10.0.3 compared to 10.0.2 *****
IMPORTANT : This version fixes a serious bug in saving the units of weight, size, surface and volume on product card.
The unit were not saved correctly in database making calculation on shipments wrong. 
Update to this version must be done if you use them and have installed version 10.0.0, 10.0.1 or 10.0.2 and set some products after installing or upgrading to one of this version.
Once update is done you must then edit (manually) the product that has bad unit to set the correct unit to have features restored.

WARNING:

Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* PHP 5.4 is no more supported. Minimum PHP is now 5.5+.
* The PHP extension php-intl is not mandatory and must be installed to have new features working correctly.
* Method GetUrlTrackingStatus were renamed into getUrlTrackingStatus for consistency with naming rules.
* API getListOfCivility has been renamed into getListOfCivilities for consistency with naming rules.
* Deprecated function img_phone as been removed. You can use img_picto(..., 'call|call_out') instead.; 
* Files for variables of themes were renamed from graph-color.php into theme_vars.inc.php to match naming 
  convention of extension .inc.php for files to be included.
* All methods set_draft() were renamed into setDraft().
* Signatures of methods createFromClone() has been standardized. All methods requires the object User as first parameter.
* Removed deprecated function function test_sql_and_script_inject that was replaced with testSqlAndScriptInject.
* Method load_measuring_units were renamed into selectMeasuringUnits and select_measuring_units was deprecated.
* Hidden option CHANGE_ORDER_CONCAT_DESCRIPTION were renamed into MAIN_CHANGE_ORDER_CONCAT_DESCRIPTION.
* Method dolEscapeXML was moved from functions.lib.php into function2.lib.php (not used enough to be loaded by default).
* Removed deprecated use of string in dol_print_date(). Only date allowed.
* Deprecated property ->fk_departement is now ->state_id everywhere.
* Removed the method 4 of GETPOST (to get $_COOKIE). It was not used and not recommanded to use in Dolibarr.
* Column llx_facture.facnumber change to llx_facture.ref
* Variable $dolibarr_main_cookie_cryptkey is no more created at install (it was not used by Dolibarr). A new variable 
  called $dolibarr_main_instance_unique_id is now generated at each installation. It will be used by some future features.

WARNING:

Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* Remove old deprecated hook 'insertExtraFields'. Triggers must be used for action on CRUD events.
* Hook 'maildao' was renamed into 'mail' into the method sendfile that send emails, and method was renamed from
  'doaction' into 'sendMail'.
* Rename trigger CONTRACT_SERVICE_ACTIVATE into LINECONTRACT_ACTIVATE and
  CONTRACT_SERVICE_CLOSE into LINECONTRACT_CLOSE
* Remove triggers *_CLONE. The trigger CREATE with context 'createfromclone' is already called so this is
  a duplicated feature. Cloning is not a business event, the business event is CREATE, so no trigger required.
* PHP 5.3 is no more supported. Minimum PHP is now 5.4+
* Remove the old deprecated code of doActions and getInstanceDao in canvas. The doActions of standard hooks are
  already available and are better.
* Removed method fetch_prods() and get_each_prod() not used, keep only get_arbo_each_prod() that is better.
* The hook contaxt commcard has been renamed thirdpartycomm
* The hook contaxt thirdpartycard has been renamed thirdpartycontact
* Remove method Categorie:get_nb_categories() that was not used.
* Hook getnomurltooltip provide a duplicate feature compared to hook getNomUrl so all hooks getnomurltooltip
  are now replaced with hook getNomUrl.
* The substitution key __CONTACTCIVNAME__ is no longer present, it has been replaced by __CONTACT_NAME_{TYPE}__
  where {TYPE} is contact type code (BILLING, SHIPPING, CUSTOMER, ... see contact type dictionnary).

WARNING:

If you enabled (for test) the experimental BlockedLog module before 7.0, you must purge the table llx_blockedlog because
way to save data for final version has changed.

Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* The methode "cloture" on contract were renamed into "closeAll".
* The method "is_erasable" of invoice return a value <= 0 if not erasable (value is meaning) instead of always 0.
* The substitution key for reference of objects is now __REF__ whatever is the object (it replaces __ORDERREF__,
  __PROPALREF__, ...)
* The substition key __SIGNATURE__ was renamed into __USER_SIGNATURE__ to follow naming conventions.
* Substitution keys with syntax %XXX% were renamed into __XXX__ to match others.
* Removed old deprecated REST API (APIs found into '/root' section of the REST API explorer in Dolibarr v6).
* Some REST API to access setup features, like dictionaries (country, town, extrafields, ...) were moved into a
  common API "/setup".
* The REST API /documents were renamed into /documents/download and /documents/upload.
* Page bank/index.php, bank/bankentries.php and comm/actions/listactions.php were renamed into
  bank/list.php, bank/bankentries_list.php and comm/actions/list.php to follow page naming
  conventions (so default filter/sort order features can also work for this pages).
* The trigger ORDER_SUPPLIER_STATUS_ONPROCESS was renamed into ORDER_SUPPLIER_STATUS_ORDERED.
* The trigger ORDER_SUPPLIER_STATUS_RECEIVED_ALL was renamed into ORDER_SUPPLIER_STATUS_RECEIVED_COMPLETELY.
* The parameter note into method cloture() is added at end of private note (previously in v6, it replaced).
* The parameter $user is now mandatory for method createFromOrder and createFromPropal.
* Removed js library 'fileupload' that was not used by core code.
* Jquery plugin tableDnd updated. You now need to use decodeURI on the return value of tableDnDSerialize()
  and add 'td.' to the beginning of the dragHandle match string.
* IE8 and earlier and Firefox 12 and earlier (< 2012) are no more supported.
* The module ExpenseReport use numbering rules that you can setup (like other modules do). If you need to
  keep the hard coded numbering rule of expenses report used in 6.0, just add constant
  EXPENSEREPORT_USE_OLD_NUMBERING_RULE to 1.
* If you use the external module "multicompany", you must also upgrade the module. Multicompany module for
  Dolibarr v7 is required because with Dolibarr v7, payment modes and payment conditions are management as data
  that are dedicated to each company. If you keep your old version of multicompany module, mode and
  condition of payments will appears empty in all companies that are not the first one. By upgrading the
  multicompany module to a version that support Dolibarr v7, everything should work as expected.

WARNING:

Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* The hook getNodeList has been replaced by a normalized 'addreplace' hook getDirList.
* The trigger USER_SETINGROUP and USER_REMOVEFROMGROUP has been replaced with trigger USER_MODIFY.
* The page societe/soc.php was renamed into societe/card.php to match page naming conventions.
* The page compta/facture.php was renamed into compta/facture/card.php to match page naming conventions.
* The signature of method ->delete() of class Product and PriceExpression was changed from
  ->delete(id, notrigger) to ->delete(User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.
* The signature of method ->delete() of class Adherent was changed from
  ->delete(id) to ->delete(id, User, notrigger) to match standard dev rules.
* Removed CommonObject::displayMarginInfos (was deprecated in 3.8). Use same method into
  html.formmargin.class.php
* Removed Societe::set_commnucation_level (was deprecated in 4.0). Was not used.
* Removed the trigger file of PAYPAL module that stored data that was not used by Dolibarr. The trigger event still
  exists, but if an external module need action on it, it must provides itself its trigger file.
* Use $conf->global->MULTICOMPANY_TRANSVERSE_MODE instead $conf->multicompany->transverse_mode. So, if you set var
  $multicompany_transverse_mode to 1 into your conf file, you must remove this line and a new key into
  the Home - setup - other admin page.
* If you use Multicompany transverse mode, it will be necessary to check the activation of the modules in the children
  entities and to review completely the rights of the groups and the users.
* Use getEntity('xxx') instead getEntity('xxx', 1) and use getEntity('xxx', 0) instead getEntity('xxx')
* Some other change were done in the way we read permission of a user when module multicompany is enabled. You can
  retreive the old behavior by adding constant MULTICOMPANY_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY to 1.
* The hook formObjectOptions was not implemented correctly in previous version. Sometimes, you had to return output
content by doing a print into function, sometimes by returning content into "resprint". This has been fixed to follow
hook specifications so you must return output into "resprint".

WARNING:

Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make
Dolibarr better:
- Function delete of class Facture (invoice) need the object $user as first parameter. Also you must
  check you make a fetch on object before calling the delete.
- The old driver of "mysql" has been removed. Dolibarr use the new one (mysqli) by default.
- Remove not used function calculate_byte(). Use dol_print_size() instead.
- Function pdf_getTotalQty is now deprecated. Not used by Dolibarr core.
- Method commande->deleteline($lineid) has been replaced with commande->deleteline($user, $lineid).
- Method expensereport->delete(id, user) has been replaced with ->delete(user)
  Method warehouse->delete(id) has been replace with ->delete(user)
  This is to follow good practice to make a fetch on object before deleting it.
- The form to add a product to a draft proposal/order/invoice, from the product card, is hidden by default.
  It was not commonly used and usage generates some problems (cost price for margin calculation not entered, vat setting).
  Set constant PRODUCT_ADD_FORM_ADD_TO to retrieve it.
- The javascript "datatables" library was previously provided into Dolibarr sources, but it was not used by application.
  So there is no reason to maintain its compatibility with other dolibarr components. If an external module need this
  library, this external module must embed the library in his own sources/packages.
- Trigger name SUPPLIER_PROPOSAL_CREATE has been renamed into PROPOSAL_SUPPLIER_CREATE.
- A new paramater sqlfilters was introduced to allow filter on any fields int the REST API. Few old parameters,
  no more required, were also removed. Use this new one if you were using one of them.
- The trigger that activate or close a contract line is run on a contract line, not on contract.
- Method commande->set_availability(user, availability_id) removed from commande class, use method commande->availability(availability_id, notrigger).

Dolibarr 5.0 was frozen before PHP 7.1 was released. Unit tests are successful on PHP 7.1 but we don't have enough
feedback to confirm whole application is compatible. Current officiel supported PHP versions are PHP 5.3 to 7.0.

WARNING:

Dolibarr 4.0 should be compatible with PHP 7 but more feedbacks are still expected to confirm that.

Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make
Dolibarr better:
- Function log() of class CommandeFournisseur has been removed. Using it is no more required.
- Class Resource was renamed into DolResource to avoid conflict with a reserved PHP word.
- Method commonobject->add_thumb() has been renamed into commonobject->addThumbs().
- Method select_type_comptes_financiers() has been renamed into selectTypeOfBankAccount()
- Property ->client that was deprecated 6 years ago, is replaced in all core code with ->thirdparty.
- File '/core/tpl/document_actions_pre_headers.tpl.php' were renamed into '/core/actions_linkedfiles.inc.php'.
So if you included it into your module, change your code like this to be compatible with all version:
  $res=@include_once DOL_DOCUMENT_ROOT . '/core/actions_linkedfiles.inc.php';
  if (! $res) include_once DOL_DOCUMENT_ROOT . '/core/tpl/document_actions_pre_headers.tpl.php';

WARNING:

Dolibarr 3.9 is not yet fully compatible with PHP 7 even if most features seems to work.

Mysql minimum version is now 5.0.3

Following changes may create regression for some external modules, but were necessary to make
Dolibarr better:
- Deprecated Product::setPriceExpression. Use Product::update instead
- Deprecated hidden option MAIN_USE_CUSTOM_TRANSLATION has been removed. Use table llx_overwrite_trans instead.
- Trigger LINECONTRACT_INSERT has been renamed into LINECONTRACT_CREATE to match common denomination.
- A lot hooks used into PDF generation were not correctly implemented. We had to fix this. The result si that
the following hook were set as hook of type "replace". This means if your module implement such hooks, it must
return 0 to execute standard code or 1 to replace standard code (value to output should be set into resPrints instead).
This is list of hooks modified:
'pdf_getlinenum', 'pdf_getlineref', 'pdf_getlineref_supplier', 'pdf_getlinevatrate', 'pdf_getlineupexcltax',
'pdf_getlineupwithtax', 'pdf_getlineqty', 'pdf_getlineqty_asked', 'pdf_getlineqty_shipped', 'pdf_getlineqty_keeptoship',
'pdf_getlineunit', 'pdf_getlineremisepercent', 'pdf_getlineprogress', 'pdf_getlinetotalexcltax', 'pdf_getlinetotalwithtax'
- Renamed Product::isservice and Product::isproduct to match PSR-2
- Remove deprecated Product::hidden property

  trigger ORDER_SUPPLIER_CREATE instead.
- Hooks 'printLeftBlock' and 'formConfirm' are now compliant with hook development rules. They are
  "addreplace" hooks, so you must return content with "->resprints='mycontent'" and not with "return 'mycontent'"
- All fields "fk_societe" and "fk_soc" are now named "fk_soc" (same name for all fields).
- Method select_PriceBaseType and load_PriceBaseType were merged into selectPriceBaseType.
- The triggers USER_LOGIN* are deprecated. They are still working but you should prefer use the
  hook afterLogin or afterLoginFailed instead.
- The trigger USER_CREATE_FROM_CONTACT has been replace with USER_CREATE and property context is now filled
  to make difference between creation from contact or not.
- Function get_exdir require now 6 parameters. This is to prepare a future feature.

- Remove the javascript function ac_delay() that is not used anymore by core code.

- Method form->select_currency() has been removed. Use instead print form->selectCurrency().
- Method form->select_methodes_commande() has been renamed into english name selectInputMethod().
- The following hooks are now 'addreplace' hooks: "formCreateThirdpartyOptions"
  So check that return value is 0 to keep default standard behaviour after hook, or 1 to disable
  default standard behaviour.
- Properties "civilite_id" were renamed into "civility_id".
- Remove add_photo_web() that is not used anymore by core code.

WARNING: Following change may create regression for some external modules, but was necessary to make
Dolibarr better:

1) We started to clean hooks code.
If your hook want to modify value of $actions, it's role of your hook to modify it. Dolibarr
hook code will no more decide this for your module. If your action class for hook was returning
a string or an array, instead your module must set $actionclassinstance->results (to return array)
or $actionclassinstance->resprints (to return string) to return same thing. The return value must
be replaced by a "return 0";
Goal is to fix old compatibility code that does not match hook specifications:
 http://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Hooks_system

2) If you implemented hook printTopRightMenu, check that output does not include '<td>' tags any more.
All content added must be tagged by a '<div>' with css class="login_block_elem"

3) Some methods object->addline used a first parameter that was object->id, some not. Of course
this was not a good practice, since object->id is already known, there is no need to provide id as
parameter. All methods addline in this case were modified to remove this parameter.

4) Method ->classer_facturee() is deprecated. It must be replace with ->classifyBilled().

5) Property ->tel on objects is now ->phone

6) Trigger LINEPROPAL_MODIFY is renamed into LINEPROPAL_UPDATE and
   Trigger CONTRACT_LINE_DELETE rnamed into LINECONTRACT_DELETE to match naming rules.

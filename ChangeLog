WARNING: Following change may create regression for some external modules, but was necessary to make
Dolibarr better:

1) We started to clean hooks code. 
If your hook want to modify value of $actions, it's role of your hook to modify it. Dolibarr 
hook code will no more decide this for your module. If your action class for hook was returning
a string or an array, instead your module must set $actionclassinstance->results (to return array) 
or $actionclassinstance->resprints (to return string) to return same thing. The return value must 
be replaced by a "return 0";
Goal is to fix old compatibility code that does not match hook specifications: 
 http://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Hooks_system   

2) If you implemented hook printTopRightMenu, check that output does not include '<td>' tags anymore.
All content added must be tagged by a '<div>' with css class="login_block_elem"

3) Some methods object->addline used a first parameter that was object->id, some not. Of course
this was not a good pratice, since object->id is already known, there is no need to provide id as 
parameter. All methods addline in this case were modified to remove this parameter. 

4) Method ->classer_facturee() is deprecated. It must be replace with ->classifyBilled().

5) Property ->tel on objects is now ->phone

Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.
DocBadgeWarningAriaHidden2=Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.

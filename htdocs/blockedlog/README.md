BLOCKED LOG
===========

## Feature
 
This module tracks, in real time, some events into a non reversible log (that you can't modify once recorded) into a block chain. 
This module provides compatibility with requirements of laws of some countries (like France with the law Fincance 2016 - Norme NF535).


**The tracked events are:**

- Invoices creation
- Payments record
- Invoice printing

You can also read and search into this dedicated log.

All record in the log are linked with the previous one in a blockchain, and content of the record is part of the
signature included into the link, so, once the module is activated, it is no more possible to erase or modify a record without corrupting all the chain.

Module Web Portal
================

This is a module to provide a ready to use Web Portal for your customers, suppliers, partners or members of the mebership module.

Accounts (login and pass) to access this portal can be created for any thirdparty (from the tab "Web site accounts").

It is better to have a standalone web server with its own virtual host and domain name to use this module, so using the web portal does not
reaveal the domain and url of your backoffice installation. 


It provides an interface to read or modify its data. This is for example, the list of the data than can be read (or modified):

If the Thirdparty module is enabled:
* Read/modify Name, phone, email, addresses of thirdparty

If the Partnership module is enabled:
* Read properties (status, start date, end date) of its partnership.

If the Proposal module is enabled:
* Read its orders

If the Sale Order module is enabled:
* Read its orders

If the Invoice module is enabled:
* Read its invoices

If the Supplier module is enabled:
* Read its price requests
* Read its orders
* Read its invoices

If module Membership is enabled:
* Read/modify Name, phone, email, addresses of thirdparty

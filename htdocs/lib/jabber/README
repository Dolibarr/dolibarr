Class.Jabber.PHP v0.4
April 27th, 2003

The Jabber Instant Messaging project is an Open Source project seeking
to provide a complete cross protocol messaging solution.  The problem
with current IM solutions is that they are all proprietary and cannot
talk to each other.  Jabber seeks to get rid of those barriers by
allowing a Jabber client to talk with an AOL user, or an IRC chat room,
or any number of other programs.

For more information about the Jabber project visit http://www.jabber.org.

Class.Jabber.PHP a PHP class that provides a PHP Developer access to the
Jabber protocol. Using this OOP class, I provide a clean interface to
writing anything from a full client to a simple protocol tester.

#
# On some specific Linux installations you could face problems with Firefox. 
# It could give you errors when loading the editor saying that some illegal
# characters were found (three strange chars in the beginning of the file).
# This could happen if you map the .js or .css files to PHP, for example.
#
# Those characters are the Byte Order Mask (BOM) of the Unicode encoded files.
# All FCKeditor files are Unicode encoded.
#
# Just rename this file to ".htaccess" and live it in the editor directory. 
# There are no security issues on doing it. It just set the ".js" and ".css" 
# files to their correct content types.

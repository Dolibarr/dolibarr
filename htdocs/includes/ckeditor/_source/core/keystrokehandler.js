/**
 * A list associating keystrokes to editor commands. Each element in the list

 *
 * This setting should be used to define (as well as to overwrite or remove) keystrokes
 * set by plugins (like `link` and `basicstyles`). If you want to set a keystroke
 * for your plugin or during the runtime, use {@link CKEDITOR.editor#setKeystroke} instead.
 *
 * Since default keystrokes are set by {@link CKEDITOR.editor#setKeystroke}
 * method, by default `config.keystrokes` is an empty array.
 *
 * See {@link CKEDITOR.editor#setKeystroke} documentation for more details
 * regarding the start up order.
 *

 *		config.keystrokes = [
 *			...
 *			[ CKEDITOR.CTRL + CKEDITOR.SHIFT + 76, 'link' ],	// CTRL + SHIFT + L
 *			...
 *		];
 *
 * To reset a particular keystroke, the following approach can be used:
 *
 *		// Disable default CTRL + L keystroke which executes link command by default.
 *		config.keystrokes = [
 *			...
 *			[ CKEDITOR.CTRL + 76, null ],						// CTRL + L
 *			...
 *		];
 *
 * To reset all default keystrokes an {@link CKEDITOR#instanceReady} callback should be
 * used. This is since editor defaults are merged rather than overwritten by
 * user keystrokes.
 *
 * **Note**: This can be potentially harmful for an editor. Avoid this unless you're
 * aware of the consequences.

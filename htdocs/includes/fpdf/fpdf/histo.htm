- Fixed a problem related to Type1 font embedding which caused trouble to some PDF processors.<br>
- The file name sent to the browser could not contain a space character.<br>

<dd>
- Image() now displays the image at 72 dpi if no dimension is given.<br>

- $HTTP_ENV_VARS has been replaced by $HTTP_SERVER_VARS.<br>
</dd>

<dd>
- Type1 font support.<br>
- Added Baltic encoding.<br>
- The class now works internally in points with the origin at the bottom in order to avoid two bugs occurring with Acrobat 5 :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* The line thickness was too large when printed under Windows 98 SE and ME.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* TrueType fonts didn't appear immediately inside the plug-in (a substitution font was used), one had to cause a window refresh to make them show up.<br>
- It is no longer necessary to set the decimal separator as dot to produce valid documents.<br>
- The clickable area in a cell was always on the left independently from the text alignment.<br>
- JPEG images in CMYK mode appeared in inverted colors.<br>
- Transparent PNG images in grayscale or true color mode were incorrectly handled.<br>
- Adding new fonts now works correctly even with the magic_quotes_runtime option set to on.<br>

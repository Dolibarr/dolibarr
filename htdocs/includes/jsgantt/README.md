A fully featured gantt chart component built entirely in Javascript, CSS and AJAX. It is lightweight and there is no need of external libraries or additional images.

You can view a live example at https://jsGanttImproved.github.io/jsgantt-improved

Features include:
  * Tasks & Collapsible Task Groups
  * Dependencies
  * Task Completion
  * Task Styling
  * Milestones
  * Resources
  * Dynamic Loading of Tasks
  * Dynamic change of format: Hour, Day, Week, Month, Quarter
  * Load Gantt from XML
    * From external files (including experimental support for MS Project XML files)
    * From JavaScript Strings
  * Support for Internationalization (all hard coded strings can be overridden)

Project forked as I was unable to contact the original maintainers. This work was done to support a personal project that didn't warrant a more heavyweight system (e.g. the dojo toolkit gantt chart features).

See the [Documentation](https://github.com/jsGanttImproved/jsgantt-improved/wiki/Documentation) wiki page or the included ``index.html`` file for instructions on use.

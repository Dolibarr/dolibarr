ChangeLog

NOTE: THIS VERSION OF PHPMAILER IS DESIGNED FOR PHP5/PHP6.
      IT WILL NOT WORK WITH PHP4.

Version 5.2.1 (January 16, 2012)
* Closed several bugs
* Performance improvements
* MsgHTML() now returns the message as required.
* New method: GetSentMIMEMessage() (returns full copy of sent message)

Version 5.2 (July 19, 2011)
* protected MIME body and header
* better DKIM DNS Resource Record support
* better aly handling
* htmlfilter class added to extras
* moved to Apache Extras

Version 5.1 (October 20, 2009)
* fixed filename issue with AddStringAttachment (thanks to Tony)
* fixed "SingleTo" property, now works with Senmail, Qmail, and SMTP in
  addition to PHP mail()
* added DKIM digital signing functionality
  New properties:
  - DKIM_domain (sets the domain name)
  - DKIM_private (holds DKIM private key)
  - DKIM_passphrase (holds your DKIM passphrase)
  - DKIM_selector (holds the DKIM "selector")
  - DKIM_identity (holds the identifying email address)
* added callback function support
  - callback function parameters include:
    result, to, cc, bcc, subject and body
  * see the test/test_callback.php file for usage.
* added "auto" identity functionality
  - can automatically add:
    - Return-path (if Sender not set)
    - Reply-To (if ReplyTo not set)
  - can be disabled:
    - $mail->SetFrom('yourname@yourdomain.com','First Last',false);
    - or by adding the $mail->Sender and/or $mail->ReplyTo properties
  Note: "auto" identity added to help with emails ending up in spam
  or junk boxes because of missing headers

Version 5.0.2 (May 24, 2009)
* Fix for missing attachments when inline graphics are present
* Fix for missing Cc in header when using SMTP (mail was sent,
  but not displayed in header -- Cc receiver only saw email To: 
  line and no Cc line, but did get the email (To receiver
  saw same)

Version 5.0.1 (April 05, 2009)
* Temporary fix for missing attachments

Version 5.0.0 (April 02, 2009)

* With the release of this version, we are initiating a new version numbering
  system to differentiate from the PHP4 version of PHPMailer.
* Most notable in this release is fully object oriented code.
class.smtp.php:
* Refactored class.smtp.php to support new exception handling
  code size reduced from 29.2 Kb to 25.6 Kb
* Removed unnecessary functions from class.smtp.php:
  public function Expand($name) {
  public function Help($keyword="") {
  public function Noop() {
  public function Send($from) {
  public function SendOrMail($from) {
  public function Verify($name) {
class.phpmailer.php:
* Refactored class.phpmailer.php with new exception handling
* Changed processing functionality of Sendmail and Qmail so they cannot be
  inadvertently used
* removed getFile() function, just became a simple wrapper for
  file_get_contents()
* added check for PHP version (will gracefully exit if not at least PHP 5.0)
class.phpmailer.php enhancements
* enhanced code to check if an attachment source is the same as an embedded or
  inline graphic source to eliminate duplicate attachments
New /test_script
* We have written a test script you can use to test the script as part of your
  installation. Once you press submit, the test script will send a multi-mime
  email with either the message you type in or an HTML email with an inline
  graphic. Two attachments are included in the email (one of the attachments
  is also the inline graphic so you can see that only one copy of the graphic
  is sent in the email). The test script will also display the functional
  script that you can copy/paste to your editor to duplicate the functionality.
New examples
* All new examples in both basic and advanced modes. Advanced examples show
  Exception handling.
PHPDocumentator (phpdocs) documentation for PHPMailer version 5.0.0
* all new documentation

Please note: the website has been updated to reflect the changes in PHPMailer
version 5.0.0. http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com/

Version 2.3 (November 06, 2008)

* added Arabic language (many thanks to Bahjat Al Mostafa)
* removed English language from language files and made it a default within
  class.phpmailer.php - if no language is found, it will default to use
  the english language translation
* fixed public/private declarations
* corrected line 1728, $basedir to $directory
* added $sign_cert_file to avoid improper duplicate use of $sign_key_file
* corrected $this->Hello on line 612 to $this->Helo
* changed default of $LE to "\r\n" to comply with RFC 2822. Can be set by the user
  if default is not acceptable
* removed trim() from return results in EncodeQP
* /test and three files it contained are removed from version 2.3
* fixed phpunit.php for compliance with PHP5
* changed $this->AltBody = $textMsg; to $this->AltBody = html_entity_decode($textMsg);
* We have removed the /phpdoc from the downloads. All documentation is now on
  the http://phpmailer.codeworxtech.com website.

Version 2.2.1 () July 19 2008

* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (my apologies, error on my part)

Version 2.2 () July 15 2008

* Fixed redirect issue (display of UTF-8 in thank you redirect)
* fixed error in getResponse function declaration (class.pop3.php)
* PHPMailer now PHP6 compliant
* fixed line 1092 in class.smtp.php (endless loop from missing = sign)

Version 2.1 (Wed, June 04 2008)

** NOTE: WE HAVE A NEW LANGUAGE VARIABLE FOR DIGITALLY SIGNED S/MIME EMAILS.
   IF YOU CAN HELP WITH LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IT WOULD BE
   APPRECIATED.

* added S/MIME functionality (ability to digitally sign emails)
  BIG THANKS TO "sergiocambra" for posting this patch back in November 2007.
  The "Signed Emails" functionality adds the Sign method to pass the private key
  filename and the password to read it, and then email will be sent with
  content-type multipart/signed and with the digital signature attached.
* fully compatible with E_STRICT error level
  - Please note:
    In about half the test environments this development version was subjected
    to, an error was thrown for the date() functions used (line 1565 and 1569).
    This is NOT a PHPMailer error, it is the result of an incorrectly configured
    PHP5 installation. The fix is to modify your 'php.ini' file and include the
    date.timezone = America/New York
    directive, to your own server timezone
  - If you do get this error, and are unable to access your php.ini file:
    In your PHP script, add
    date_default_timezone_set('America/Toronto');
    - do not try to use
    $myVar = date_default_timezone_get();
    as a test, it will throw an error.
* added ability to define path (mainly for embedded images)
  function MsgHTML($message,$basedir='') ... where:
  $basedir is the fully qualified path
* fixed MsgHTML() function:
  - Embedded Images where images are specified by <protocol>:// will not be altered or embedded
* fixed the return value of SMTP exit code ( pclose )
* addressed issue of multibyte characters in subject line and truncating
* added ability to have user specified Message ID
  (default is still that PHPMailer create a unique Message ID)
* corrected unidentified message type to 'application/octet-stream'
* fixed chunk_split() multibyte issue (thanks to Colin Brown, et al).
* added check for added attachments
* enhanced conversion of HTML to text in MsgHTML (thanks to "brunny")

Version 2.1.0beta2 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)
* implemented updated EncodeQP (thanks to coolbru, aka Marcus Bointon)
* finished all testing, all known bugs corrected, enhancements tested
- note: will NOT work with PHP4.

please note, this is BETA software
** DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION OR LIVE PROJECTS
INTENDED STRICTLY FOR TESTING

Version 2.1.0beta1
please note, this is BETA software
** DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION OR LIVE PROJECTS
INTENDED STRICTLY FOR TESTING

Version 2.0.0 rc2 (Fri, Nov 16 2007), interim release
* implements new property to control VERP in class.smtp.php
  example (requires instantiating class.smtp.php):
  $mail->do_verp = true;
* POP-before-SMTP functionality included, thanks to Richard Davey
  (see class.pop3.php & pop3_before_smtp_test.php for examples)
* included example showing how to use PHPMailer with GMAIL
* fixed the missing Cc in SendMail() and Mail()

******************
A note on sending bulk emails:

If the email you are sending is not personalized, consider using the
"undisclosed-recipient:;" strategy. That is, put all of your recipients
in the Bcc field and set the To field to "undisclosed-recipients:;".
It's a lot faster (only one send) and saves quite a bit on resources.
Contrary to some opinions, this will not get you listed in spam engines -
it's a legitimate way for you to send emails.

A partial example for use with PHPMailer:

$mail->AddAddress("undisclosed-recipients:;");
$mail->AddBCC("email1@anydomain.com,email2@anyotherdomain.com,email3@anyalternatedomain.com");

Many email service providers restrict the number of emails that can be sent
in any given time period. Often that is between 50 - 60 emails maximum
per hour or per send session.

If that's the case, then break up your Bcc lists into chunks that are one
less than your limit, and put a pause in your script.
*******************

Version 2.0.0 rc1 (Thu, Nov 08 2007), interim release
* dramatically simplified using inline graphics ... it's fully automated and requires no user input
* added automatic document type detection for attachments and pictures
* added MsgHTML() function to replace Body tag for HTML emails
* fixed the SendMail security issues (input validation vulnerability)
* enhanced the AddAddresses functionality so that the "Name" portion is used in the email address
* removed the need to use the AltBody method (set from the HTML, or default text used)
* set the PHP Mail() function as the default (still support SendMail, SMTP Mail)
* removed the need to set the IsHTML property (set automatically)
* added Estonian language file by Indrek P&auml;ri
* added header injection patch
* added "set" method to permit users to create their own pseudo-properties like 'X-Headers', etc.
  example of use:
  $mail->set('X-Priority', '3');
  $mail->set('X-MSMail-Priority', 'Normal');
* fixed warning message in SMTP get_lines method
* added TLS/SSL SMTP support
  example of use:
  $mail = new PHPMailer();
  $mail->Mailer = "smtp";
  $mail->Host = "smtp.example.com";
  $mail->SMTPSecure   = "tls"; // option
  //$mail->SMTPSecure   = "ssl";  // option
  ...
  $mail->Send();

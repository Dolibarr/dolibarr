/**
 * Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both
 * recurring and one-time purchases of products. <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#products">Products</a> help you track
 * inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different
 * physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and
 * pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change
 * prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
 *
 * For example, you might have a single &quot;gold&quot; product that has prices
 * for $10/month, $100/year, and â‚¬9 once.

 * and prices</a>.
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
 * @property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
 * @property bool $active Whether the price can be used for new purchases.
 * @property string $billing_scheme Describes how to compute the price per period. Either <code>per_unit</code> or <code>tiered</code>. <code>per_unit</code> indicates that the fixed amount (specified in <code>unit_amount</code> or <code>unit_amount_decimal</code>) will be charged per unit in <code>quantity</code> (for prices with <code>usage_type=licensed</code>), or per unit of total usage (for prices with <code>usage_type=metered</code>). <code>tiered</code> indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as defined using the <code>tiers</code> and <code>tiers_mode</code> attributes.
 * @property int $created Time at which the object was created. Measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
 * @property string $currency Three-letter <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html">ISO currency code</a>, in lowercase. Must be a <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/currencies">supported currency</a>.
 * @property bool $livemode Has the value <code>true</code> if the object exists in live mode or the value <code>false</code> if the object exists in test mode.
 * @property null|string $lookup_key A lookup key used to retrieve prices dynamically from a static string.
 * @property \Stripe\StripeObject $metadata Set of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata">key-value pairs</a> that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
 * @property null|string $nickname A brief description of the plan, hidden from customers.
 * @property string|\Stripe\Product $product The ID of the product this price is associated with.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $recurring The recurring components of a price such as <code>interval</code> and <code>usage_type</code>.
 * @property \Stripe\StripeObject[] $tiers Each element represents a pricing tier. This parameter requires <code>billing_scheme</code> to be set to <code>tiered</code>. See also the documentation for <code>billing_scheme</code>.
 * @property null|string $tiers_mode Defines if the tiering price should be <code>graduated</code> or <code>volume</code> based. In <code>volume</code>-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per unit price. In <code>graduated</code> tiering, pricing can change as the quantity grows.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $transform_quantity Apply a transformation to the reported usage or set quantity before computing the amount billed. Cannot be combined with <code>tiers</code>.
 * @property string $type One of <code>one_time</code> or <code>recurring</code> depending on whether the price is for a one-time purchase or a recurring (subscription) purchase.
 * @property null|int $unit_amount The unit amount in %s to be charged, represented as a whole integer if possible.
 * @property null|string $unit_amount_decimal The unit amount in %s to be charged, represented as a decimal string with at most 12 decimal places.

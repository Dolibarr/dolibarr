 * SKUs describe specific product variations, taking into account any combination
 * of: attributes, currency, and cost. For example, a product may be a T-shirt,
 * whereas a specific SKU represents the <code>size: large</code>, <code>color:
 * red</code> version of that shirt.
 *
 * Can also be used to manage inventory.

If, for example, a product's attributes are <code>[&quot;size&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;]</code>, a valid SKU has the following dictionary of attributes: <code>{&quot;size&quot;: &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;Unisex&quot;}</code>.

The first version of the script was developed in 2009 and it was hosted at https://code.google.com/p/php-mobile-detect/, it was a small project with around 30 stars. (Original blog post by Victor: http://victorstanciu.ro/detectarea-platformelor-mobile-in-php/)

In December 2011 it received a major update from the first version, an important number of issues were fixed, then 2.0 was launched. The new version marks a new mindset and also featuring tablet detection.

Throughout 2012 the script has been updated constantly and we have received tons of feedback and requests. 

In July 2012 we moved the repository from Google Code to GitHub in order to quickly accommodate the frequent updates and to involve more people.

In August 2013 the library has 1800+ stargazers and support for: composer, PHPUnit tests, PSR standards and a new webpage http://mobiledetect.net

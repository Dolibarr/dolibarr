Interpreting the SEPA Field
===========================

Note that some IIBAN providers may in fact provide SEPA connectivity.

Thus, implementers are reminded to consider the reported SEPA status
of a country within the registry as confirming rather than negating
the potential SEPA status of a potential financial institution who
may be party to a proposed transaction.

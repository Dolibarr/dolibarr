 - Finnish record suggests position at which to pad domestic account
   numbers in order to reach a BBAN / IBAN, this data could be of
   some use for certain applications and would be nice to include
 - Addition of information regarding preferred human-level formatting
   for each country's BBAN - worthwhile?
 - Addition of 'date effective' information for records such as BH
   and the UAE that published data in advance of deployment
 - Support for calculating or validating any known national (sub-
   BBAN-level) checksum algorithms?
 - URLs to national-level BBAN format specifications
 - Consider adding a library of localised forms and abbreviations
   for account number portions, for example Austria and Germany seem
   to have 'Kontonummer' (KTO) for account number, and 'Bankleitzah'
   (BLZ) for bank identifier. This could assist greatly with 
   deployments requiring international and/or constrained input.
 - Consider building a library of national-level bank or payment
   institution identifier codes. This would be rather large and an
   optional extension and would be in competition with SWIFTRef.

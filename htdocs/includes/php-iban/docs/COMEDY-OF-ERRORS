This file lists specific errors observed in the official IBAN specification.

In addition to the specific errors, there persist basic outstanding
matters that cause issue for implementers:
 - Non 1:1 mapping of records to countries (eg: French territories, etc.)
 - Mixing of free text and hard data in specification fields
 - Lack of validation of information in fields prior to publishing
 - Lack of synchronisation between TXT and PDF versions of the registry

2011-07-16
----------
 - No information for Kuwait past sixth column
 - Total absence of information regarding Kazakhstan
 - '1.00001E+15' instead of a valid BBAN example for Lithuania
 - Repeated IBAN example in human format instead of IBAN format-
   specification for UAE
 - Incorrect domestic example for Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Latvia,
   Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mauritius, Romania, San Marino
   (complete, human-format IBAN instead of domestic example)

Early 2012
----------
 - Inconsistent record ordering (KW, KZ)
 - Inconsistent capitalization (DK)
 - Continued presence of incorrect domestic examples

February 2013
-------------
 - Deployment of unparseable special values such as "Not in use" (FI).
 - Still(!) missing a registry entry for 2010's 'new' entry of Khazakstan

September 2013
--------------
 - Azerbaijan, Brazil, Costa Rica, Palestine, Virgin Islands 'SEPA 
   Country' field in PDF (yes/no) is completely blank

March 2014
----------
 - In multiple cases, territories of a major country have a SEPA status
   that differs from the parent jurisdiction. The IBAN specification as
   previously released does not include individual records for these
   territories, and thus cannot convey this important information.
 - The IBAN registry's old URL is no longer publicly available! Its now
   ends in a 404, and the apparent new home, located over at
   http://www.swift.com/products_services/by_type/reference_data/iban_registry_iso13616
   does not have any content. The parent portion of this part of the
   SWIFT website suggests the information may have been moved to a new
   'SWIFTRef' site, however that site appears to only peddle paid for
   directories of BICs and similar. The new location after much
   searching was found to be http://www.swift.com/products_services/bic_and_iban_format_registration_iban_format_r

June 2014
---------
 - The TXT registry records of QA and JO do not match those within the 
   PDF and are essentially spurious while looking roughly correct. Dang.

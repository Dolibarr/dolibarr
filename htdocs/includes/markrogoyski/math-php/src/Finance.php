     * Financial payment for a loan or annuity with compound interest.
     * Determines the periodic payment amount for a given interest rate,

     * of payments, and whether the payments are made at the start or end
     * of each payment period.

     * of the period. In the common case of a payment at the end of a period,
     * the factor is 1 and reduces to the formula above. Setting when=1 computes

     *   pmt(0.035/12, 5*12, 265000, 265000/2, false)
     *
     * The weekly payment into a savings account with 1% interest rate and current

     *   pmt(0.01/52, 3*52, -1500, 10000, false)
     * The present_value is negative indicating money put into the savings account,

     * Interest on a financial payment for a loan or annuity with compound interest.
     * Determines the interest payment at a particular period of the annuity. For
     * a typical loan paid down to zero, the amount of interest and principle paid
     * throughout the lifetime of the loan will change, with the interest portion
     * of the payment decreasing over time as the loan principle decreases.
     *
     * Same as the =IPMT() function in most spreadsheet software.

     * See the PMT function for derivation of the formula. For IPMT, we have
     * the payment equal to the interest portion and principle portion of the payment:
     *
     * PMT = IPMT + PPMT
     *
     * The interest portion IPMT on a regular annuity can be calculated by computing
     * the future value of the annuity for the prior period and computing the compound
     * interest for one period:
     *
     * IPMT = FV(p=n-1) * rate
     *
     * For an "annuity due" where payment is at the start of the period, period=1 has
     * no interest portion of the payment because no time has elapsed for compounding.
     * To compute the interest portion of the payment, the future value of 2 periods
     * back needs to be computed, as the definition of a period is different, giving:
     *
     * IPMT = (FV(p=n-2) - PMT) * rate
     *
     * By thinking of the future value at period 0 instead of the present value, the
     * given formulas are computed.
     *
     * Example of regular annuity and annuity due for a loan of $10.00 paid back in 3 periods.
     * Although the principle payments are equal, the total payment and interest portion are
     * lower with the annuity due because a principle payment is made immediately.

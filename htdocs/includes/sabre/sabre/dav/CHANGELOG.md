  [sabre/http 4.2.2][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],

3.2.0 (2016-06-27)
------------------

* The default ACL rules allow an unauthenticated user to read information
  about nodes that don't have their own ACL defined. This was a security
  problem.
* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],
  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],

3.2.0-alpha1 (2016-05-09)
-------------------------

* Database changes for CalDAV. If you are using the CalDAV PDO backends, you
  must migrate. Run `./bin/migrateto32.php` for more info.
* Support for WebDAV Resource Sharing, an upcoming standard.
* Added support for sharing in the CalDAV PDO backend! Users can now invite
  others to their calendar and give them read/read-write access!
* #397: Support for PSR-3. You can now log exceptions with your favourite
  psr3-compatible logging tool.
* #825: Actual proper, tested support for PostgreSQL. We require version 9.5.
* Removed database migration script for sabre/dav 1.7. To update from that
  version you now first need to update to sabre/dav 3.1.
* Removed deprecated function: `Sabre\DAV\Auth\Plugin::getCurrentUser()`.
* #774: Fixes for getting free disk space on Windows.
* #803: Major changes in the sharing API. If you were using an old sabre/dav
  sharing api, head to the website for more detailed migration notes.
* #657: Support for optional auth using `{DAV:}unauthorized` and `{DAV:}all`
  privileges. This allows you to assign a privilege to a resource, allowing
  non-authenticated users to access it. For instance, this could allow you
  to create a public read-only collection.
* #812 #814: ICS/VCF exporter now includes a more useful filename in its
  `Content-Disposition` header. (@Xenopathic).
* #801: BC break: If you were using the `Href` object before, it's behavior
  now changed a bit, and `LocalHref` was added to replace the old, default
  behavior of `Href`. See the migration doc for more info.
* Removed `Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::$allowAccessToNodesWithoutACL` setting.
  Instead, you can provide a set of default ACL rules with
  `Sabre\DAVACL\Plugin::setDefaultAcl()`.
* Introduced `Sabre\DAVACL\ACLTrait` which contains a default implementation
  of `Sabre\DAV\IACL` with some sane defaults. We're using this trait all over
  the place now, reducing the amount of boilerplate.
* Plugins can now control the "Supported Privilege Set".
* Added Sharing, ICSExport and VCFExport plugins to `groupwareserver.php`
  example.
* The `{DAV:}all` privilege is now no longer abstract, so it can be assigned
  directly. We're using the `{DAV:}all` privilege now in a lot of cases where
  we before assigned both `{DAV:}read` and `{DAV:}write`.
* Resources that are not collections no longer support the `{DAV:}bind` and
  `{DAV:}unbind` privileges.
* Corrected the CalDAV-scheduling related privileges.
* Doing an `UNLOCK` no longer requires the `{DAV:}write-content` privilege.
* Added a new `getPrincipalByUri` plugin event. Allowing plugins to request
  quickly where a principal lives on a server.
* Renamed `phpunit.xml` to `phpunit.xml.dist` to make local modifications easy.
* Functionality from `IShareableCalendar` is merged into `ISharedCalendar`.
* #751: Fixed XML responses from failing `MKCOL` requests.
* #600: Support for `principal-match` ACL `REPORT`.
* #599: Support for `acl-principal-prop-set` ACL `REPORT`.
* #798: Added an index on `firstoccurence` field in MySQL CalDAV backend. This
  should speed up common calendar-query requests.
* #759: DAV\Client is now able to actually correctly resolve relative urls.
* #671: We are no longer checking the `read-free-busy` privilege on individual
  calendars during freebusy operations in the scheduling plugin. Instead, we
  check the `schedule-query-freebusy` privilege on the target users' inbox,
  which validates access for the entire account, per the spec.
* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],
  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],
  [sabre/uri 1.1.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.4.1][xml].

3.1.4 (2016-05-28)
------------------

* #834: Backport from `master`: Return vCards exactly as they were stored if
  we don't need to convert in between versions. This should speed up many
  large addressbook syncs sometimes up to 50%.
* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],
  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],

  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],

  to a new plugin: `Sabre\CalDAV\Notifications\Plugin`. If you want to use
  notifications-related functionality, just add this plugin.

  method MUST be implemented by all backends, but the `AbstractBackend` has a
  simple default implementation for this.

  `Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarHome`.
* Changed: `Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarRootNode` has been renamed to
  `Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarRoot`.

  support, it is no longer needed. It's functionality has been replaced by
  `Sabre\CalDAV\Schedule\IMipPlugin`, which can now send emails for clients
  other than iCal.
* Removed: `Sabre\DAV\ObjectTree` and `Sabre\DAV\Tree\FileSystem`. All this
  functionality has been merged into `Sabre\DAV\Tree`.

* Directory entries in the Browser plugin are sorted by type and name.
  (@aklomp)
* #486: It's now possible to return additional properties when an 'allprop'
  PROPFIND request is being done. (@aklomp)
* Changed: Now return HTTP errors when an addressbook-query REPORT is done
  on a uri that's not a vcard. This should help with debugging this common
  mistake.
* Changed: `PUT` requests with a `Content-Range` header now emit a 400 status
  instead of 501, as per RFC7231.
* Added: Browser plugin can now display the contents of the
  `{DAV:}supported-privilege-set` property.

  restricting it yet.
* Added: Support for `CARDDAV:supported-collation-set`.
* Changed: CardDAV plugin is now responsible for reporting

------------------

* Added `Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarRoot` as an alias for
  `Sabre\CalDAV\CalendarRootNode`. The latter is going to be deprecated in 2.1,

  [sabre/http 2.0.3][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.0][evnt].
* BC Break: Property updating and fetching got refactored. Read the [migration
  document][mi20] for more information. This allows for creation of a generic
  property storage, and other property-related functionality that was not
  possible before.
* BC Break: Removed `propertyUpdate`, `beforeGetProperties` and
  `afterGetProperties` events.
* Fixed: #413: Memory optimizations for the CardDAV PDO backend.
* Updated: Brand new browser plugin with more debugging features and a design
  that is slightly less painful.
* Added: Support for the `{DAV:}supported-method-set` property server-wide.
* Making it easier for implementors to override how the CardDAV addressbook
  home is located.
* Fixed: Issue #422 Preconditions were not being set on PUT on non-existent
  files. Not really a chance for data-loss, but incorrect nevertheless.

* Switched to PSR-4
* Fixed: #175. Returning ETag header upon a failed `If-Match` or
  `If-None-Match` check.

  Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate_IFile interface is now deprecated and will be
  removed in a future version.
* Added: `Sabre\DAV\Exception\LengthRequired`.

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 3.1.3, sabre/http 2.0.0alpha5, and
  sabre/event 1.0.0.
* BC Break: The CardDAV and CalDAV BackendInterface each have a new method:
  getMultipleCards and getMultipleCalendarObjects. The Abstract and PDO backends
  have default implementations, but if you implement that interface directly,
  this method is now required.
* BC Break: XML property classes now receive an extra argument in their
  unserialize method ($propertyMap). This allows for recursively parsing
  properties, if needed.
* BC Break: Now using sabre/event for event emitting/subscription. For plugin
  authors this means Server::subscribeEvent is now Server::on, and
  Server::broadcastEvent is now Server::emit.
* BC Break: Almost all core functionality moved into a CorePlugin.
* BC Break: Most events triggered by the server got an overhaul.
* Changed: Sabre\HTTP now moved into a dedicated sabre/http package.

  clients to manage a list of subscriptions on the server.
* Added: Support for emitting and receiving jCal instead of iCalendar for
  CalDAV.
* Added: BasicCallback authenticaton backend, for creating simple authentication
  systems without having to define any classes.
* Added: A $transactionType property on the server class. This can be used for
  logging and performance measuring purposes.
* Fixed: If event handlers modify the request body from a PUT request, an ETag
  is no longer sent back.
* Added: Sabre\DAV\IMultiGet to optimize requests that retrieve information
  about lists of resources.
* Added: MultiGet support to default CalDAV and CardDAV backends, speeding up
  the multiget and sync reports quite a bit!
* Added: ICSExportPlugin can now generate jCal, filter on time-ranges and expand
  recurrences.
* Fixed: Read-only access to calendars still allows the sharee to modify basic
  calendar properties, such as the displayname and color.
* Changed: The default supportedPrivilegeSet has changed. Most privileges are no
  longer marked as abstract.
* Changed: More elegant ACL management for CalendarObject and Card nodes.
* Added: Browser plugin now marks a carddav directory as type Directory, and a
  shared calendar as 'Shared'.
* Added: When debugExceptions is turned on, all previous exceptions are also
  traversed.
* Removed: Got rid of the Version classes for CalDAV, CardDAV, HTTP, and DAVACL.
  Now that there's no separate packages anymore, this makes a bit more sense.
* Added: Generalized the multistatus response parser a bit more, for better
  re-use.
* Added: Sabre\DAV\Client now has support for complex properties for PROPPATCH.
  (Issue #299).
* Added: Sabre\DAV\Client has support for gzip and deflate encoding.
* Added: Sabre\DAV\Client now has support for sending objects as streams.
* Added: Deserializer for {DAV:}current-user-privilege-set.
* Added: Addressbooks or backends can now specify custom acl rules when creating
  cards.
* Added: The ability for plugins to validate custom tokens in If: headers.
* Changed: Completely refactored the Lock plugin to deal with the new If: header
  system.
* Added: Checking preconditions for MOVE, COPY, DELETE and PROPPATCH methods.
* Added: has() method on DAV\Property\SupportedReportSet.
* Added: If header now gets checked (with ETag) all the time. Before the dealing
  with the If-header was a responsibility of the Locking plugin.
* Fixed: Outbox access for delegates.
* Added: Issue 333: It's now possible to override the calendar-home in the
  CalDAV plugin.
* Added: A negotiateContentType to HTTP\Request. A convenience method.
* Fixed: Issue 349: Denying copying or moving a resource into it's own subtree.
* Fixed: SabreDAV catches every exception again.
* Added: Issue #358, adding a component=vevent parameter to the content-types
  for calendar objects, if the caldav backend provides this info.

1.8.0 (2012-11-08)
------------------

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.
* BC Break: Moved the entire codebase to PHP namespaces.
* BC Break: Every backend package (CalDAV, CardDAV, Auth, Locks, Principals) now

  AbstractBackend class.
* BC Break: Changed a bunch of constructor signatures in the CalDAV package, to
  reduce dependencies on the ACL package.

1.7.12 (2014-05-15)
-------------------

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.4.

  Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate_IFile interface is now deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version.
* Fixed: Restoring old setting after changing libxml_disable_entity_loader.
* Fixed: Issue #422: Preconditions were not being set on PUT on non-existent
  files. Not really a chance for data-loss, but incorrect nevertheless.
* Fixed: Issue #427: Now checking preconditions on DELETE requests.
* Fixed: Issue #428: Etag check with If: fails if the target is a collection.
* Fixed: Issue #393: PATCH request with missing end-range was handled

  (which is often way to small).
* Fixed: The browser plugin potentially allowed people to open any arbitrary
  file on windows servers (CVE-2013-1939).


1.7.5 (2013-03-01)
------------------

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.6.
* Change: No longer advertising support for 4.0 vcards. iOS and OS X address
  book don't handle this well, and just advertising 3.0 support seems like the
  most logical course of action.
* Added: ->setVerifyPeers to Sabre_DAV_Client (greatly resisting against it,
  don't use this..).


1.7.4 (2013-01-19)
------------------

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.
* Changed: To be compatible with MS Office 2011 for Mac, a workaround was
  removed that was added to support old versions of Windows XP (pre-SP3).

  and we can't keep that workaround to be compatible with another MS product.
* Fixed: expand-properties REPORT had incorrect values for the href element.

  Klomp).
* Fixed: Changed serialization of {DAV:}getlastmodified and {DAV:}supportedlock
  to improve compatibility with MS Office 2011 for Mac.
* Changed: reverted the automatic translation of 'DAV:' xml namespaces to
  'urn:DAV' when parsing files. Issues were reported with libxml 2.6.32, on a
  relatively recent debian release, so we'll wait till 2015 to take this one out
  again.
* Added: Sabre_DAV_Exception_ServiceUnavailable, for emitting 503's.


1.7.3 (2012-12-01)
------------------

* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.
* Fixed: Removing double slashes from getPropertiesForPath.

* Fixed: some bugfixes in postgres sql script.
* Fixed: When requesting some properties using PROPFIND, they could show up as
  both '200 Ok' and '403 Forbidden'.
* Fixed: calendar-proxy principals were not checked for deeper principal
  membership than 1 level.
* Fixed: setGroupMemberSet argument now correctly receives relative principal
  urls, instead of the absolute ones.
* Fixed: Server class will filter out any bonus properties if any extra were
  returned. This means the implementor of the IProperty class can be a bit
  lazier when implementing. Note: bug numbers after this line refer to Google
  Code tickets. We're using github now.


1.7.1 (2012-10-07)
------------------

* Fixed: include path problem in the migration script.


1.7.0 (2012-10-06)
------------------

* BC Break: The calendarobjects database table has a bunch of new fields, and a
  migration script is required to ensure everything will keep working. Read the
  wiki for more details.
* BC Break: The ICalendar interface now has a new method: calendarQuery.
* BC Break: In this version a number of classes have been deleted, that have
  been previously deprecated. Namely: - Sabre_DAV_Directory (now:
  Sabre_DAV_Collection) - Sabre_DAV_SimpleDirectory (now:
  Sabre_DAV_SimpleCollection)
* BC Break: Sabre_CalDAV_Schedule_IMip::sendMessage now has an extra argument.
  If you extended this class, you should fix this method. It's only used for
  informational purposes.
* BC Break: The DAV: namespace is no longer converted to urn:DAV. This was a
  workaround for a bug in older PHP versions (pre-5.3).
* Removed: Sabre.includes.php was deprecated, and is now removed.
* Removed: Sabre_CalDAV_Server was deprecated, and is now removed. Please use
  Sabre_DAV_Server and check the examples in the examples/ directory.
* Changed: The Sabre_VObject library now spawned into it's own project! The
  VObject library is still included in the SabreDAV zip package.
* Added: Experimental interfaces to allow implementation of caldav-sharing. Note
  that no implementation is provided yet, just the api hooks.
* Added: Free-busy reporting compliant with the caldav-scheduling standard. This
  allows iCal and other clients to fetch other users' free-busy data.
* Added: Experimental NotificationSupport interface to add caldav notifications.
* Added: VCF Export plugin. If enabled, it can generate an export of an entire
  addressbook.
* Added: Support for PATCH using a SabreDAV format, to live-patch files.
* Added: Support for Prefer: return-minimal and Brief: t headers for PROPFIND
  and PROPPATCH requests.
* Changed: Responsibility for dealing with the calendar-query is now moved from
  the CalDAV plugin to the CalDAV backends. This allows for heavy optimizations.
* Changed: The CalDAV PDO backend is now a lot faster for common calendar
  queries.
* Changed: We are now using the composer autoloader.
* Changed: The CalDAV backend now all implement an interface.
* Changed: Instead of Sabre_DAV_Property, Sabre_DAV_PropertyInterface is now the
  basis of every property class.
* Update: Caching results for principal lookups. This should cut down queries
  and performance for a number of heavy requests.
* Update: ObjectTree caches lookups much more aggresively, which will help
  especially speeding up a bunch of REPORT queries.
* Added: Support for the schedule-calendar-transp property.
* Fixed: Marking both the text/calendar and text/x-vcard as UTF-8 encoded.
* Fixed: Workaround for the SOGO connector, as it doesn't understand receiving
  "text/x-vcard; charset=utf-8" for a contenttype.
* Added: Sabre_DAV_Client now throws more specific exceptions in cases where we
  already has an exception class.
* Added: Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate. This plugin allows you to use the PATCH method
  to update parts of a file.
* Added: Tons of timezone name mappings for Microsoft Exchange.
* Added: Support for an 'exception' event in the server class.
* Fixed: Uploaded VCards without a UID are now rejected. (thanks Dominik!)

  supported-calendar-component list. (thanks Armin!)
* Fixed: Issue 219: serialize() now reorders correctly.
* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_XMLUtil no longer returns empty $dom->childNodes if there is
  whitespace in $dom.
* Fixed: Returning 409 Conflict instead of 500 when an attempt is made to create
  a file as a child of something that's not a collection.
* Fixed: Issue 237: xml-encoding values in SabreDAV error responses.
* Fixed: Returning 403, instead of 501 when an unknown REPORT is requested.

  file on windows servers. (CVE-2013-1939).


1.6.7 (2013-03-01)
------------------

* Change: No longer advertising support for 4.0 vcards. iOS and OS X address
  book don't handle this well, and just advertising 3.0 support seems like the
  most logical course of action.
* Added: ->setVerifyPeers to Sabre_DAV_Client (greatly resisting against it,
  don't use this..).


1.6.6 (2013-01-19)
------------------

* Fixed: Backported a fix for broken XML serialization in error responses.
  (Thanks @DeepDiver1975!)

* Fixed: Compatibility for OS/X 10.8 iCal in the IMipHandler.
* Fixed: Issue 222: beforeWriteContent shouldn't be called for lock requests.
* Fixed: Problem with POST requests to the outbox if mailto: was not lower
  cased.
* Fixed: Yearly recurrence rule expansion on leap-days no behaves correctly.
* Fixed: Correctly checking if recurring, all-day events with no dtstart fall in

  of an event, but not the end.
* Fixed: All-day recurring events wouldn't match if an occurence ended exactly
  on the start of a time-range.
* Fixed: HTTP basic auth did not correctly deal with passwords containing colons
  on some servers.

------------------

* Added: It's now possible to specify in Sabre_DAV_Client which type of
  authentication is to be used.
* Fixed: Issue 206: Sabre_DAV_Client PUT requests are fixed.
* Fixed: Issue 205: Parsing an iCalendar 0-second date interval.

* Fixed: DTSTART and DTEND would be incorrect for expansion of WEEKLY BYDAY
  recurrences.
* Fixed: Issue 203: A problem with overridden events hitting the exact date and
  time of a subsequent event in the recurrence set.
* Fixed: There was a problem with recurrence rules, for example the 5th tuesday
  of the month, if this day did not exist.
* Added: New HTTP status codes from draft-nottingham-http-new-status-04.


1.6.1 (2012-03-05)
------------------

* Added: createFile and put() can now return an ETag.
* Added: Sending back an ETag on for operations on CardDAV backends. This should
  help with OS X 10.6 Addressbook compatibility.

1.6.0 (2012-02-22)
------------------

* BC Break: Now requires PHP 5.3

  'searchPrincipals' and 'updatePrincipal'.
* BC Break: Sabre_DAV_ILockable is removed and all related per-node locking
  functionality.
* BC Break: Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound is now deprecated in favor of
  Sabre_DAV_Exception_NotFound. The former will be removed in a later version.

* BC Break: Sabre_CalDAV_Server is now deprecated, check out the documentation
  on how to setup a caldav server with just Sabre_DAV_Server.

  browser plugin.
* Added: Browser plugin: icons for various nodes.
* Added: Support for FREEBUSY reports!

  DAVACL, HTTP, VObject) as an alternative to the autoloader. This often works
  much faster.
* Added: Support for the 'Me card', which allows Addressbook.app users specify
  which vcard is their own.
* Added: Support for updating principal properties in the DAVACL principal
  backends.
* Changed: Major refactoring in the calendar-query REPORT code. Should make
  things more flexible and correct.
* Changed: The calendar-proxy-[read|write] principals will now only appear in
  the tree, if they actually exist in the Principal backend. This should reduce
  some problems people have been having with this.
* Changed: Sabre_VObject_Element_* classes are now renamed to
  Sabre_VObject_Property. Old classes are retained for backwards compatibility,
  but this will be removed in the future.
* Added: Sabre_VObject_FreeBusyGenerator to generate free-busy reports based on

  in getCards, if etag and size are specified. This may speed up certain
  requests.
* Added: More arguments to beforeWriteContent and beforeCreateFile (see
  WritingPlugins wiki document).
* Added: Hook for iCalendar validation. This allows us to validate iCalendar
  objects when they're uploaded. At the moment we're just validating syntax.

  result in much lower memory use.
* Fixed: Issue 187: Sabre_DAV_UUIDUtil was missing from includes file.
* Fixed: Issue 191: beforeUnlock was triggered twice.


1.5.6 (2012-01-07)

------------------

* Added: CardDAV support.
* Added: An experimental WebDAV client.
* Added: MIME-Directory grouping support in the VObject library. This is very
  useful for people attempting to parse vcards.
* BC Break: Adding parameters with the VObject libraries now overwrites the
  previous parameter, rather than just add it. This makes more sense for 99% of
  the cases.
* BC Break: lib/Sabre.autoload.php is now removed in favor of
  lib/Sabre/autoload.php.
* Deprecated: Sabre_DAV_Directory is now deprecated and will be removed in a

------------------

* Fixed: Issue 131: Custom CalDAV backends could break in certain cases.
* Added: The option to override the default tablename all PDO backends use.
  (Issue 60).
* Fixed: Issue 124: 'File' authentication backend now takes realm into
  consideration.
* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_Property_HrefList now properly deserializes. This allows
  users to update the {DAV:}group-member-set property.

* Added: VObject library can now automatically map iCalendar properties to
  custom classes.


1.4.3 (2011-04-25)
------------------

* Fixed: Issue 123: Added workaround for Windows 7 UNLOCK bug.
* Fixed: datatype of lastmodified field in mysql.calendars.sql. Please change
  the DATETIME field to an INT to ensure this field will work correctly.

* Added: It's not possible to disable listing of nodes that are denied read
  access by ACL.
* Fixed: Changed a few properties in CalDAV classes from private to protected.
* Fixed: Issue 119: Terrible things could happen when relying on guessBaseUri,
  the server was running on the root of the domain and a user tried to access a
  file ending in .php. This is a slight BC break.
* Fixed: Issue 118: Lock tokens in If headers without a uri should be treated as
  the request uri, not 'all relevant uri's.
* Fixed: Issue 120: PDO backend was incorrectly fetching too much locks in cases
  where there were similar named locked files in a directory.


1.4.1-beta (2011-02-26)
-----------------------

* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_PDO returned too many locks.
* Fixed: Sabre_HTTP_Request::getHeader didn't return Content-Type when running
  on apache, so a few workarounds were added.
* Change: Slightly changed CalDAV Backend API's, to allow for heavy
  optimizations. This is non-bc breaking.


1.4.0-beta (2011-02-12)
-----------------------

* Added: Partly RFC3744 ACL support.
* Added: Calendar-delegation (caldav-proxy) support.
* BC break: In order to fix Issue 99, a new argument had to be added to
  Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_*::getLocks classes. Consult the classes for details.
* Deprecated: Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_FS is now deprecated and will be removed
  in a later version. Use PDO or the new File class instead.
* Deprecated: The Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendarUtil class is now marked deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future version. Please use Sabre_VObject instead.
* Removed: All principal-related functionality has been removed from the
  Sabre_DAV_Auth_Plugin, and moved to the Sabre_DAVACL_Plugin.
* Added: VObject library, for easy vcard/icalendar parsing using a natural
  interface.
* Added: Ability to automatically generate full .ics feeds off calendars. To
  use: Add the Sabre_CalDAV_ICSExportPlugin, and add ?export to your calendar
  url.
* Added: Plugins can now specify a pluginname, for easy access using
  Sabre_DAV_Server::getPlugin().
* Added: beforeGetProperties event.
* Added: updateProperties event.
* Added: Principal listings and calendar-access can now be done privately,
  disallowing users from accessing or modifying other users' data.
* Added: You can now pass arrays to the Sabre_DAV_Server constructor. If it's an
  array with node-objects, a Root collection will automatically be created, and
  the nodes are used as top-level children.
* Added: The principal base uri is now customizable. It used to be hardcoded to
  'principals/[user]'.
* Added: getSupportedReportSet method in ServerPlugin class. This allows you to
  easily specify which reports you're implementing.
* Added: A '..' link to the HTML browser.
* Fixed: Issue 99: Locks on child elements were ignored when their parent nodes
  were deleted.
* Fixed: Issue 90: lockdiscovery property and LOCK response now include a
  {DAV}lockroot element.

* Fixed: Issue 102: Ensuring that copy and move with identical source and
  destination uri's fails.

* Fixed: Issue 109: Small fixes in Sabre_HTTP_Util.
* Fixed: Issue 111: Properly catching the ownername in a lock (if it's a string)
* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_ObjectTree::nodeExist always returned false for the root
  node.
* Added: Global way to easily supply new resourcetypes for certain node classes.
* Fixed: Issue 59: Allowing the user to override the authentication realm in
  Sabre_CalDAV_Server.
* Update: Issue 97: Looser time-range checking if there's a recurrence rule in
  an event. This fixes 'missing recurring events'.


1.3.0 (2010-10-14)
------------------

* Added: childExists method to Sabre_DAV_ICollection. This is an api break, so
  if you implement Sabre_DAV_ICollection directly, add the method.
* Changed: Almost all HTTP method implementations now take a uri argument,
  including events. This allows for internal rerouting of certain calls. If you
  have custom plugins, make sure they use this argument. If they don't, they
  will likely still work, but it might get in the way of future changes.
* Changed: All getETag methods MUST now surround the etag with double-quotes.
  This was a mistake made in all previous SabreDAV versions. If you don't do
  this, any If-Match, If-None-Match and If: headers using Etags will work
  incorrectly. (Issue 85).
* Added: Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_AbstractBasic class, which can be used to easily
  implement basic authentication.
* Removed: Sabre_DAV_PermissionDenied class. Use Sabre_DAV_Forbidden instead.
* Removed: Sabre_DAV_IDirectory interface, use Sabre_DAV_ICollection instead.

* Fixed: If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since would be incorrect if the
  date is an exact match.
* Fixed: Support for multiple ETags in If-Match and If-None-Match headers.
* Fixed: Improved baseUrl handling.
* Fixed: Issue 67: Non-seekable stream support in ::put()/::get().
* Fixed: Issue 65: Invalid dates are now ignored.
* Updated: Refactoring in Sabre_CalDAV to make everything a bit more ledgable.

* Added: RFC5397 - current-user-principal support.
* Fixed: Issue 27: encoding entities in property responses.

  with the Sabre_DAV_Server::$debugExceptions property.
* Added: Moved autoload from lib/ to lib/Sabre/autoload.php. This is also the
  case in the upcoming 1.2.0, so it will improve future compatibility.


1.0.14 (2010-04-15)
-------------------

* Fixed: double namespace declaration in multistatus responses.


1.0.13 (2010-03-30)

* Fixed: Issue 19 regression for MS Office


1.0.6 (2010-02-23)

* Fixed: Improved unittests and build system


1.0.4 (2010-01-11)
------------------

* Fixed: needed 2 different releases. One for googlecode and one for pearfarm.
  This is to retain the old method to install SabreDAV until pearfarm becomes
  the standard installation method.


1.0.3 (2010-01-11)
------------------

* Added: RFC4709 support (davmount)
* Added: 6 unittests
* Added: naturalselection. A tool to keep cache directories below a specified

1.0.0 (2009-11-02)
------------------

* Added: SimpleDirectory class. This class allows creating static directory
  structures with ease.
* Changed: Custom complex properties and exceptions now get an instance of
  Sabre_DAV_Server as their first argument in serialize()
* Changed: Href complex property now prepends server's baseUri
* Changed: delete before an overwriting copy/move is now handles by server class
  instead of tree classes
* Changed: events must now explicitly return false to stop execution. Before,
  execution would be stopped by anything loosely evaluating to false.
* Changed: the getPropertiesForPath method now takes a different set of
  arguments, and returns a different response. This allows plugin developers to
  return statuses for properties other than 200 and 404. The hrefs are now also
  always calculated relative to the baseUri, and not the uri of the request.
* Changed: generatePropFindResponse is renamed to generateMultiStatus, and now
  takes a list of properties similar to the response of getPropertiesForPath.
  This was also needed to improve flexibility for plugin development.
* Changed: Auth plugins are no longer included. They were not yet stable
  quality, so they will probably be reintroduced in a later version.
* Changed: PROPPATCH also used generateMultiStatus now.
* Removed: unknownProperties event. This is replaced by the afterGetProperties
  event, which should provide more flexibility.
* Fixed: Only calling getSize() on IFile instances in httpHead()
* Added: beforeBind event. This is invoked upon file or directory creation
* Added: beforeWriteContent event, this is invoked by PUT and LOCK on an
  existing resource.
* Added: beforeUnbind event. This is invoked right before deletion of any
  resource.
* Added: afterGetProperties event. This event can be used to make modifications
  to property responses.
* Added: beforeLock and beforeUnlock events.
* Added: afterBind event.
* Fixed: Copy and Move could fail in the root directory. This is now fixed.
* Added: Plugins can now be retrieved by their classname. This is useful for
  inter-plugin communication.
* Added: The Auth backend can now return usernames and user-id's.
* Added: The Auth backend got a getUsers method
* Added: Sabre_DAV_FSExt_Directory now returns quota info


0.12.1-beta (2009-09-11)
------------------------

----------------------

* Updated: Browser plugin now shows multiple {DAV:}resourcetype values if
  available.
* Added: Experimental PDO backend for Locks Manager
* Fixed: Sending Content-Length: 0 for every empty response. This improves NGinx
  compatibility.

  Finder compatibility.


0.11-beta (2009-08-11)
----------------------

* Updated: Now in Beta
* Updated: Pear package no longer includes docs/ directory. These just contained
  rfc's, which are publicly available. This reduces the package from ~800k to
  ~60k
* Added: generatePropfindResponse now takes a baseUri argument
* Added: ResourceType property can now contain multiple resourcetypes.
* Fixed: Issue 13.


0.10-alpha (2009-08-03)
-----------------------

* Added: Plugin to automatically map GET requests to non-files to PROPFIND

* Added: Ability to choose to use auth-int, auth or both for HTTP Digest
  authentication. (Issue 11)
* Changed: Made more methods in Sabre_DAV_Server public.
* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter plugin now intercepts HTTP LOCK requests to
  non-existent files. (Issue 12)
* Added: Central list of defined xml namespace prefixes. This can reduce
  Bandwidth and legibility for xml bodies with user-defined namespaces.
* Added: now a PEAR-compatible package again, thanks to Michael Gauthier
* Changed: moved default copy and move logic from ObjectTree to Tree class

0.9a-alpha (2009-07-21)
----------------------

* Fixed: Broken release

0.9-alpha (2009-07-21)
----------------------

* Changed: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree objects.
  The Server class now directly works with the INode, IFile and IDirectory
  objects. If you created your own Tree objects, this will most likely break in
  this release.
* Changed: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes into a
  separate plugin.
* Changed: TemporaryFileFilter is now a plugin.
* Added: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of the
  includer script, and is preferred by some people.
* Added: AWS Authentication class.
* Added: simpleserversetup.py script. This will quickly get a fileserver up and
  running.
* Added: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a priority.
  This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication Plugin is used
  before any other Plugin.
* Added: 22 new tests.
* Added: Users-manager plugin for .htdigest files. Experimental and subject to
  change.
* Added: RFC 2324 HTTP 418 status code
* Fixed: Exclusive locks could in some cases be picked up as shared locks
* Fixed: Digest auth for non-apache servers had a bug (still not actually tested
  this well).


0.8-alpha (2009-05-30)
----------------------

* Changed: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every
  Exception now follows Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound convention instead of
  Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException.
* Added: Browser plugin now allows uploading and creating directories straight
  from the browser.
* Added: 12 more unittests
* Fixed: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.
* Fixed: Netdrive support
* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter filtered out too many files. Fixed some of the
  regexes.
* Fixed: Added README and ChangeLog to package


0.7-alpha (2009-03-29)
----------------------

* Added: System to return complex properties from PROPFIND.
* Added: support for {DAV:}supportedlock.
* Added: support for {DAV:}lockdiscovery.
* Added: 6 new tests.
* Added: New plugin system.
* Added: Simple HTML directory plugin, for browser access.
* Added: Server class now sends back standard pre-condition error xml bodies.
  This was new since RFC4918.
* Added: Sabre_DAV_Tree_Aggregate, which can 'host' multiple Tree objects into
  one.
* Added: simple basis for HTTP REPORT method. This method is not used yet, but
  can be used by plugins to add reports.
* Changed: ->getSize is only called for files, no longer for collections. r303
* Changed: Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter
* Changed: Sabre_DAV_TemporaryFileFilter is now called
  Sabre_DAV_Tree_TemporaryFileFilter.
* Changed: removed functions (get(/set)HTTPRequest(/Response)) from Server
  class, and using a public property instead.
* Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't show up
  in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)
* Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.
* Fixed: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per RFC4918 sec
  8.2.
* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter now lets through GET's if they actually exist on
  the backend. (r274)
* Fixed: Some methods didn't get passed through in the FilterTree (r283).
* Fixed: LockManager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly less.
  (r287)


0.6-alpha (2009-02-16)
----------------------

* Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings. This means it won't
  require to hold entire files in memory, which can be an issue if you're
  dealing with big files. Note that this breaks compatibility for put() and
  createFile methods.
* Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.
* Added: Support for HTTP Range header
* Added: Support for ETags within If: headers
* Added: The API can now return ETags and override the default Content-Type
* Added: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using PHPUnit.
* Added: 49 unittests.
* Added: Abstraction for the HTTP request.
* Updated: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags are
  serialized as {namespace}tagName instead of namespace#tagName
* Fixed: HTTP_BasicAuth class now works as expected.
* Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.
* Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.
* Fixed: PROPFIND now sends back information about the requestUri even when
  "Depth: 1" is specified.


0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)
----------------------

* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP file
  streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a WebDAV to FTP
  proxy.
* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.
* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Response class. This centralizes HTTP operations and will be
  a start towards the creating of a testing framework.
* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements are
  removed from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of
  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made to allow
  easier integration into applications not using this standard inclusion model.
* Updated: Better in-file documentation.
* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.
* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.
* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.
* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to
  Sabre_HTTP_Response.
* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.

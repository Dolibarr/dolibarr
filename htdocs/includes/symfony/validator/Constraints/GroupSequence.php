/**
 * A sequence of validation groups.
 *
 * When validating a group sequence, each group will only be validated if all
 * of the previous groups in the sequence succeeded. For example:
 *
 *     $validator->validate($address, null, new GroupSequence(['Basic', 'Strict']));
 *
 * In the first step, all constraints that belong to the group "Basic" will be
 * validated. If none of the constraints fail, the validator will then validate
 * the constraints in group "Strict". This is useful, for example, if "Strict"
 * contains expensive checks that require a lot of CPU or slow, external
 * services. You usually don't want to run expensive checks if any of the cheap
 * checks fail.
 *
 * When adding metadata to a class, you can override the "Default" group of
 * that class with a group sequence:
 *     /**
 *      * @GroupSequence({"Address", "Strict"})
 *      *\/
 *     class Address
 *     {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 *
 * Whenever you validate that object in the "Default" group, the group sequence
 * will be validated:
 *
 *     $validator->validate($address);
 *
 * If you want to execute the constraints of the "Default" group for a class
 * with an overridden default group, pass the class name as group name instead:
 *
 *     $validator->validate($address, null, "Address")
 *
 * @Annotation
 * @Target({"CLASS", "ANNOTATION"})

2012-04-19 21:07 +0000 [r2226]  Stevan_White:

	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: re-named
	  alefmaksurainitialarabic and alefmaksuramedialarabic as
	  alefmaksurainitialarabic and alefmaksuramedialarabic to avoid a
	  confusing FontForge warning. This was discussed on the FontForge

	* FreeSerif.sfd: GPOS table: removed the
	  Cyrillic kerns with non-Unicode "alternative" Cyrillic, because
	  FontForge warns that Windows apps will have *problems* with
	  mappings that aren't Unicode-Unicode. Most of the kerns were
	  rather small anyway.

	  Persion digits 500EM wide.

2012-04-09 18:35 +0000 [r2205]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: messed with digits.
	  Overall, had been building with GIT version of FontForge. found
	  that older distro version 22-Feb-2011-ML shows warning dialogs
	  Internal Error: EITOfNextMajor failed! on Clockwise Test
	  (cleverly omitting the crucial info). Turns out, just rounding to
	  int on certain characters fixes it.

2012-04-09 11:34 +0000 [r2204]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: More kerning: tried
	  to synch up normal and bold. Altered letters especially for
	  Seraiki. Lots of fiddling with heh and heh-doachashmee. Seems the
	  letter transforms very differently for different languages. This
	  is not there yet.

2012-04-08 12:53 +0000 [r2203]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: made 'ccmp' table
	  and some combining marks to handle cases of letters that don't
	  have positional forms in Unicode. Only did a few -- more are
	  needed. Lots of kerning. Fiddled with shapes of several letters.

2012-04-07 19:21 +0000 [r2202]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Arabic: more alterations toward
	  bug #36115: Various little problems with Arabic/Persian glyphs
	  More kerning. Some forms from Pashto are missing.

2012-04-06 17:45 +0000 [r2201]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: made medial form of
	  loop-letters more distinctive from initial forms. (toward bug bug
	  #36115: Various little problems with Arabic/Persian glyphs)

2012-04-05 16:43 +0000 [r2200]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic: improvements to
	  digits (Persian primarily) based on patch from Masoud Pourmoosa.

2012-04-04 17:10 +0000 [r2199]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Arabic; (for Farsi) toward
	  bug 34700: made farsi yeh final more like the Unicode samples.
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?34700 Arabic/Persian in FreeSerif:
	  ending "Yeh" is annoying

	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Various attempts to make
	  web fonts work/look better. Sans Devanagari: made relation
	  between overhang and horizontal more consistent for half-forms.
	  Corrected metrics in FreeSansOblique. Some kerning overall, after
	  looking again at sample pages

2012-04-02 13:30 +0000 [r2197]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd: Devanagari: toward more
	  consistent spacing, especialy of half-forms

2012-04-02 12:57 +0000 [r2196]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Devanagri: better connection of

2012-04-01 13:45 +0000 [r2195]  Stevan_White:

	  handling, doc

2012-03-28 19:20 +0000 [r2183]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: cleaned up a
	  bunch of excess GPOS anchors; tidied lookups.

2012-03-28 09:17 +0000 [r2180-2182]  Stevan_White:

	* Makefile: insert troubleshooting doc

	* notes/troubleshooting.txt (added): A doc
	  explaining how to troubleshoot font problems.

	* notes/usage.txt: Tidied, more explanation of the
	  doc as a whole.

2012-03-26 10:43 +0000 [r2179]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: much experimenting
	  with lookups to center western punctuation between words
	  (resulted in several bug reports on firefox and xetex).
	  Currently, uses GSUB 'locl'. GPOS are too problematic in apps to
	  use.

2012-03-25 09:49 +0000 [r2178]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd: Devanagari: added
	  positioning for western punctuation

2012-03-25 09:40 +0000 [r2177]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,

	  hyphenated term

2012-03-24 10:20 +0000 [r2175]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: regarding
	  horizontal spacing, on advice of Zdenek. o, au -- stems were too
	  close. danda, dbldanda: much too near preceding word. Made so
	  that danda-space would space the mark evenly between the words.
	  Made lookups for similarly-spaced question and exclamation marks.
	  Kerning (or dist?): Experiments -- problems include: Firefox
	  doesn't seem to support "dist". Xetex doesn't turn kerning on by
	  default. Fontforge complains Windows doesn't like to kern
	  auxiliaries with Unicode ranges. Nonetheless, it does pack words
	  rather tighter. My own advice: made ra glyph more narrow. It was
	  the worst, spacing wise, on the un-kerned page. Oriya: made
	  similar spacing for its danda.

2012-03-23 12:56 +0000 [r2174]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: efforts to
	  improve horizontal spacing, that Zdenek complains about. 1)
	  medium: o, au vowels: stems too close 2) danda, dbldanda, should
	  be widely separated from words, centred between them. 3) bold: on
	  horizontal, bevels extend rather more than they should (reduced
	  in Unicode and through first set of half marks in the
	  auxiliaries... willl complete later.) 4) made special localized
	  forms of question, exclamation mark.

2012-03-22 23:25 +0000 [r2172-2173]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/generate/TrueType,
	  tools/generate/WOFF,
	  tools/generate/OpenType: Set the encoding to
	  UnicodeFull before build (a bit wasteful for faces with no high
	  Unicode, but couldn't think of a better way.)

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: More re-thinking of OS/2
	  weights. In sans, again adjusted OS/2 Windows metrics to stop
	  clipping. (I'm just sure this will mess up line spacing in
	  OpenOffice, but didn't have time to check. Something has a bug.)

	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Overall: Several
	  measures toward reducing warnings from Font Validator. In "roman"
	  faces, change TTF Name: SubFamily to "Regular". (FontForge binds
	  this to PSNames:Weight --? so changed that.) Experimenting with
	  General:Name For Humans (Fiddled with Family Name too...but
	  changed it back.) Changes to OS/2:Sub/Super Subscript Offset --
	  made positive. Some fiddling with Panose info. Also: previously
	  OS/2 Charsets missed 708, Arabic ASMO 708. (Bug in
	  FontForge-patch reported.) In sans and mono oblique, bold, and
	  boldoblique, added some math operators to fill an Apple codepage.
	  Sinhala: FreeSerifBold -- implemented same change moving 'ccmp'
	  to 'akhn' as in roman face. Has to do with bug in OpenOffice/ICU.

2012-03-19 09:45 +0000 [r2163]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: correction-something went wrong
	  with the encoding two commits ago. (I switched encoding from
	  custom to BMP and back again.) This should encorporate the recent
	  changes and fix the problem.

2012-03-19 09:07 +0000 [r2162]  Stevan_White:

	  commit didn't quite do it. Sometimes, but starting the generate
	  process from scratch, it still crashed. But this "circle" glyph
	  was excessively elaborate anyway. Made it simpler, cleaned it up,
	  and now the crash isn't happening.

2012-03-09 13:12 +0000 [r2134]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Mahjong Tiles: work-around for

	  also bn_asamib_r_ukaar. Copied holes from similar glyphs. A
	  similar thing may have happend to a couple of other ligs
	  (bn_ss_tta1, bn_ss_tt_ra1). I don't know how these should look,
	  but they seem to be unused anyway.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: mostly messing with
	  mark positioning: got rid of carat-reph forms.

2012-02-17 11:28 +0000 [r2065]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: further glyph
	  clean-up, adjustments to mark placement.

	  added some lookups for above marks.

2012-02-17 00:14 +0000 [r2062-2063]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Correction: kerning tables were
	  blown out in commit 2056. There were several bad crashes about
	  that time. The effect seems to be: all kern table entries are set
	  to 0.

	* sfd/Makefile, FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: kerning tables restored.
	  Problem happened in commit 2096

2012-02-16 23:41 +0000 [r2061]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: more glyph clean-up,
	  mostly in auxiliaries. Just noticed all kern tables have been
	  zeroed again (thank you, FontForge).

2012-02-16 21:11 +0000 [r2060]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: glyph clean-up of
	  Unicode range, some of auxiliary glyphs.

2012-02-15 20:16 +0000 [r2059]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: more glyph clean-up,
	  re-naming. much more to do.

2012-02-15 17:12 +0000 [r2058]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujurati: removed anusvara and
	  nukta lookups in preference of positioning. general glyph
	  clean-up. deleted a bunch of unused characters. Oriya: general
	  glyph clean-up.

2012-02-14 23:59 +0000 [r2057]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: Again, from Samak
	  Gujarati font (full GPL 3.0 with font exception) Scaled slightly
	  to fit bounds, moved some letters, renamed a few. Lots more to
	  do.

2012-02-14 22:35 +0000 [r2056]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: reverting previous commit.
	  lookup tables somehow got damaged

2012-02-14 20:40 +0000 [r2055]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gujarati: From Samak Gujarati
	  font (full GPL 3.0 with font exception) Scaled slightly to fit
	  bounds, moved some letters, renamed a few. Lots more to do.

2012-02-14 19:37 +0000 [r2054]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: Deleted range, over
	  questions of its provenance. Tut mir leid.

2012-02-13 23:16 +0000 [r2052-2053]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: cleaned up 'virama'
	  glyph.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: cleaned up 'aa'
	  glyph.

2012-02-13 23:11 +0000 [r2051]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: cleaned up 'a' glyph.

2012-02-13 23:06 +0000 [r2049-2050]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: compacted auxiliary
	  glyphs a bit.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: removed most holonto and
	  nukta forms in preference for positioning lookups

2012-02-13 21:08 +0000 [r2048]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: made to validate

2012-02-13 20:55 +0000 [r2047]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: regularized horizontal
	  placement and spacing, mostly increasing spacing a bit. Got rid
	  of nukta substitution table in favor of positioning lookup;
	  likewise with all anusvara lookups. The glyphs of this range are
	  still very erratic, and the weight is substantially greater than
	  that of the rest of the face.

2012-02-13 13:56 +0000 [r2046]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujarati: shifted entire range
	  up by 44EM, so it didn't dangle so. Fiddled with mark placement.

2012-02-13 00:01 +0000 [r2045]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: improved vowel a.

2012-02-12 23:29 +0000 [r2044]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Gurmukhi: replaced range with
	  glyphs from 'singh' metafont by Amarjit Singh
	  http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/gurmukhi/ The 'singh'
	  font is properly GPL. And the overall look is much more like
	  serif than what had been there. Status: added a few letters and
	  tables. Two marks were unrepresented in 'singh', and are
	  leftovers. I made a ya_halant and a ra below-form. Also made
	  substitution and positioning tables. Worst: the vowel 'a' is very
	  messed up -- much too heavy; hand-drawn. Will have to replace it.
	  Also need to review the missing marks. Pity there's no bold...

2012-02-12 22:02 +0000 [r2043]  Stevan_White:

	  complete range. re-named letters for consistency with other indic
	  languages. fixed a broken table.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Oriya: Re-introduced, using
	  Samak Oriya, a GPL v.3 + font exception.
	  http://sarovar.org/projects/samyak/ Already the original is
	  altered in several ways. The glyphs need a lot of work.

2012-02-10 12:03 +0000 [r2035]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/report/OpenType/UnicodeRanges.py: corrected
	  Private Use range

	  Malayalam: corrected problems caused by recent inconsistent
	  naming.

2012-02-09 16:36 +0000 [r2032]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Gujurati: named characters
	  better -- makes it easier to see table problems. Found one error
	  in tables, fixed. There are others.

2012-02-08 19:55 +0000 [r2031]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: several new tables in
	  effort to resolve spacing bug.

2012-02-08 15:37 +0000 [r2030]  Stevan_White:

2012-02-08 15:15 +0000 [r2029]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tamil: Toward resolution of bug
	  #35479: Tamil in FreeSerif: some ligatures wrong
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?35479 Removed GSUB tables
	  about positioning the virama; implemented this with a GPOS table
	  and anchor points. Corrected tables for sshri, kss ligatures.
	  Toward resolution of bug #35480: Tamil in FreeSerif: placement of
	  vowel marks poor https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?35480
	  Made a vertical ii sign, made a contextual chain that replaces
	  the normal ii with this one for certain letters.

2012-02-08 01:41 +0000 [r2028]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Malayalam: Added subtable for
	  nta (mal_n1rh), Separated 'psts' subtable into u and uu ones, and
	  everything else, hoping somehow to deal with the orthographic
	  reform.

	  Unicode additions

2012-02-06 19:24 +0000 [r2025]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: Latin: Fixed broken
	  kerning. Problem was: there was an entry for 'f' as the first
	  letter in two subtables of the same lookup. The second subtable
	  was ignored, even though there was no match for the second letter
	  in the first lookup. That is, within a kern lookup, the first
	  letters of the pairs should be unique.

2012-02-06 14:41 +0000 [r2023-2024]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Most of the
	  previous commits about Hindi were in error: two columns of the
	  velthuis manual for Modern Hindi and Old Hindi were swapped. This
	  now implements Modern Hindi, except for one conjunct. Old Hindi
	  conjuncts are moved to separate tables, but Old Hindi is not
	  specifically supported.

2012-01-23 18:48 +0000 [r1997]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: several table

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Sanskrit/Hindi
	  distinction now seems to be working. (Was order of two 'akhn'
	  tables, one specialized for Sanskrit. Don't understand--thought
	  always all matching tables were executed.)

2012-01-20 01:41 +0000 [r1993]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: some clean-up,
	  split the akhn table into general (modern Hindi) and Sanskrit.
	  But not the Sanskrit doesn't activate in any environment, with
	  lang='sa'. However, seems to work for Hindi.

2012-01-18 14:40 +0000 [r1986]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: Much messing with
	  combined forms for vowels+rakh, finally got features going for
	  distinction of Rakaar slash vs Rakaar below mark.

2012-01-16 00:36 +0000 [r1985]  Stevan_White:

2012-01-08 01:32 +0000 [r1975]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Devanagari: copied in rest of
	  Unicode chars from velthuis font dvng10.pfb with advice from
	  Zdeněk Wagner. Next plan: copy in ligatures from same file and
	  use a cmap file provided by Zdeněk to construct a basic GSUB
	  table.

2012-01-08 00:25 +0000 [r1974]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Latin, Cyrillic: tweeks to

	  the past... Cleaned up some lookups. In other ranges, added
	  script ranges for MS "new layout engine", e.g. dev2, bng2. Note:
	  Malayalam is mlm2, not mly2 as in Fontforge.

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Latin Extended-A:
	  Applied Daniel Johnson's patch that made two versions of capital
	  Eng. His explanation: ' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8A The
	  form of capital Eng currently in all three FreeFont faces is that
	  used by the Sami people, resembling a capital N with a hooked
	  right descender. However, the form preferred for African and
	  Amerindian languages resembles a tall lowercase n with a hook
	  that almost meets the left vertical. (See wikipedia link above
	  for a visual.) Recommend moving the existing Sami-style Eng to a
	  PUA or non-Unicode slot, creating African-style Eng at U+014A,
	  and adding a LOCL table with substitution rules for Inari Sami
	  (ISM), Lule Sami (LSM), Northern Sami (NSM) and Skolt Sami (SKS).
	  ' Latin Extended-B: Also in his patch: added U+0220 (Latin
	  Capital Letter N with long leg)

	  for extrema and self-intersection problmes . re-naming glyphs
	  whose PS names are too long. . removing blank glyphs . giving
	  Unicode points to glyphs missing them. There are still a few

	  lookups in somewhat better way. Control Pictures: added a bunch
	  (but... is it worth it?)

2010-09-12 15:01 +0000 [r1503]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/range_report.py: Added a Private Use total

2010-09-11 09:48 +0000 [r1498]  Stevan_White:

	  small letters to same depth as in Latin Expanded bowl of Fei and
	  fei to resemble other samples.

2010-09-10 21:38 +0000 [r1497]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Cyrillic: mostly positioning of
	  marks for old Cyrillic alphabets

2010-09-10 08:05 +0000 [r1496]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Coptic: Replaced acoptic with
	  something more dramatic, fiddled with kerning, tidied some other
	  letters

2010-09-08 22:50 +0000 [r1495]  Stevan_White:

	* AUTHORS, CREDITS: mention of recent

	  glyphs to re-order vowels, courtesy of Mohammad Anwari.

2010-09-07 17:39 +0000 [r1489]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Osmanya: courtesy of Daniel
	  Johnson. Note this script is slanted in every sample I've seen.
	  That is justification enough that the glyphs in this range look
	  slated, although the face isn't oblique.

2010-09-07 17:19 +0000 [r1488]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: UCAS Extended: by Daniel Johnson

2010-09-07 16:43 +0000 [r1487]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Sinhala: complete replacement
	  of range with glyphs extracted more directly from Yannis
	  Haralambous' sinha TeX font (last version was also derived from
	  this font, but had undergone detrimental processing). Implements
	  "rak" glyphs using three GSUB lookup steps.

2010-09-04 23:52 +0000 [r1486]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fix for FontForge warning (v
	  20090923) "On Windows many apps will have problems with this
	  font's kerning, because because 58 of its glyph kern pairs cannot
	  be mapped to unicode-BMP kern pairs" This was due to kern tables
	  for the Musical Symbols range, which isn't in the Unicode Basic
	  Multilingual Plane. Removed this lookup. Might consider another
	  way to position these symbols.

2010-08-29 22:59 +0000 [r1485]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Resolves class of validation
	  problems in Sinhala: Bad Glyph Name. This is a FontForge bug,
	  that appears when certain types of problems occur in the glyph
	  contours. Probably an arithmetic error causes some corruption.

	* FreeMono.sfd: Named letters in several

2010-04-08 20:20 +0000 [r1433]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Fixed problem with name.
	  This should be the same as before the revision except for the
	  fix. The KDE font installer was saying this face was incorrectly
	  named Free Serif Bold Italic, but this wasn't quite correct. One
	  of the other language names said it was named Free Serif Halvfett
	  Kursiv, which conflicted with that language name for the real
	  Free Serif Bold Italic.

2010-04-08 17:26 +0000 [r1432]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: regression: for some

	  NOT UNICODE they are to satisfy an essentially undocumented
	  "feature" of FontForge, ( in source tottf.c, AssignNotdefNull() )
	  And a funny strong suggestion of TrueType fonts, that they begin
	  with three special characters (evidently different from encoding
	  slots) http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm
	  FontForge looks for these glyphs in certain places and copies
	  them. Otherwise, apparently, it will find a glyph elsewhere
	  (unclear how) and copy it there, possibly resulting in something
	  quite wrong (such as a non-monospace font). The three are copied
	  to the end of TTF fonts (only one to the end of OTF fonts)

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Increased angle of
	  hook on numeral 'one', to improve distinction from letter 'l' at
	  small point sized. (Noticed that on some systems, even at 12
	  point the distinction had not been obvious.)

2009-03-29 13:56 +0000 [r1253]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd: General Punctuation:
	  Adjust position, shape of quotes, fiddle with others.

2009-03-29 12:12 +0000 [r1252]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Kerning: Had grouped letters
	  with round bowls on left (e,c,0,d,q) together, but now see the
	  original Nimbus fonts had left bounds that vary by 10 EM or more,
	  which is quite visible. I am correcting a flaw in the original
	  font in a very difficult and complex way. It would be much better
	  to make the bounds of these similar letters to be equal. To do:
	  same for punctuation, copy to other styles of Sans

2009-03-29 03:48 +0000 [r1251]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Glagolitic: more fiddling.
	  Raised small letters so their tops are even with the tops of the
	  big letters, which is more in line with their "hanging" nature,
	  and with most manuscripts.

2009-03-04 07:03 +0000 [r1238]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/ranges.py: ranges for Sinhala

2009-03-03 09:54 +0000 [r1237]  Stevan_White:

	  improvements (Note: the characters still missing I simply haven't
	  yet recognized in a manuscript or found in an on-line HTML
	  encoded text. I would like to see real ones rather than copying
	  out of the Unicode samples.) Cyrillic Extended B: Assembled
	  Monograph Uk, uk. See discussion

2009-02-28 00:14 +0000 [r1231]  Stevan_White:

	  U+13d2

2009-02-24 07:41 +0000 [r1227]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Sinhala: Copied most Unicode
	  glyphs directly from Yannis Haralambous sinhala MetaFont files.
	  These are: all but 0dd0 0dd1 0df4. Gave Unicode characters names,
	  based on a transliteration scheme from Harshula. The auxiliary
	  Sinhala are all from the LKLUG font.

2009-02-22 23:41 +0000 [r1226]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Copied glyphs from LKLUG font,
	  as discussed with Harshula Jayasuriya.
	  http://sinhala.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sinhala/sinhala/fonts/
	  This font is derived from a Metafont font: This package was
	  originally developed by Yannis Haralambous (Yannis.Haralambous at
	  univ-lille1 fr), with funding from the Wellcome Institute for the
	  History of Medicine, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE, England
	  (Contact person: Dominik Wujastyk (D.Wujastyk at ucl ac uk)),
	  which is using the font in its Catalogue of Sinhala Manuscript.
	  The original package was available by ftp at ftp.bcc.ac.uk in:
	  /pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software/sinhala1-TeX.zip The hope is
	  to eventually pull glyphs directly from the original MF files.

2009-02-18 20:38 +0000 [r1223]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Armenian: spacing changes
	  Sinhala: deleted range, for usual reasons: It doesn't even
	  contain the full set of Unicode letters, and Sinhala requires
	  auxiliary characters and lookup tables for proper representation.
	  (Found what I think are the originals at

2008-11-10 19:49 +0000 [r1059]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Made a few combining
	  characters to be zero-width in Mono, Added them to other styles.

2008-11-09 23:49 +0000 [r1058]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Figured out why below marks
	  in Thai weren't working in the lowest letters. I think Pango and
	  other font renderers ignore 'blwm'. 'mark' works though.

2008-11-09 23:21 +0000 [r1057]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Tweeks to Thai marks

2008-11-09 22:56 +0000 [r1056]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Several bugfixes in Thai,
	  mostly having to do with mark placement and ligatures.
	  Implemented ru-saraaa and lu-saraaa with ligatures.

2008-11-09 21:21 +0000 [r1055]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: added and named
	  dottedcircle (used by Pango to render combining mark base)

2008-11-09 12:42 +0000 [r1054]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: More tweeks to Coptic

2008-11-09 12:22 +0000 [r1053]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tweeks to Coptic, after viewing
	  more papyrus samples and web pages.

2008-11-09 10:41 +0000 [r1052]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Weight of Coptic small letters
	  made to match that of Latin and Greek ones.

2008-11-08 20:05 +0000 [r1051]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Coptic tweek spacing

2008-11-08 19:22 +0000 [r1050]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Made Coptic to comply better
	  with http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html Made a flourish
	  at foot of letters with long diagonal.

2008-11-08 15:51 +0000 [r1049]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Coptic: punctuation marks were
	  in the wrong row.

2008-11-08 15:38 +0000 [r1048]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: More tweeks to Coptic; put in a
	  mark lookup table. Note: for small letters I made scaled
	  references to captials. Results in those letters looking quite
	  light next to the capitals and next to small Latin letters. Also,
	  there are a few variant forms for capitals (Unicode samples don't
	  show this). It would be good to re-work

2008-11-08 13:27 +0000 [r1047]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added Coptic alphabet in
	  u+2C80-2CB1 and u+03E2-u+03EF, drawn/built by me, based on
	  Unicode samples, TeX font copte, and scans at WikiPedia.

2008-11-07 08:12 +0000 [r1046]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Further tweeks to dieresis
	  in Greek and Cyrillic

2008-11-07 07:41 +0000 [r1045]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: replaced Greek I dieresis with
	  references, tweeked height of dieresis.

2008-11-04 08:42 +0000 [r1044]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added a few Cyrillic Extended-B
	  letters seen in web pages while looking for Glagolitic text.

2008-11-04 00:29 +0000 [r1042-1043]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd: Added a few old Cyrillic
	  characters.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Several corrections and tweeks
	  to Glagolitic. Still missing six slots from Unicode, but don't
	  see them in the TeX fonts. On the other hand, several on-line
	  Glagolitic pages (bibles etc) don't seem to use these. Maybe it's
	  OK as-is.

2008-11-03 09:53 +0000 [r1041]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added lowercase range to
	  Glagolitic, as a facile scaling of the uppercase.

2008-11-03 09:50 +0000 [r1040]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added letter to Glagolitic,
	  scaled range.

2008-11-02 22:59 +0000 [r1039]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Replaced fraktur bold from
	  Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols with that from TX Fonts by
	  Young Ryu. One concern: letter k is damaged (in both medium and
	  bold). I just hacked something up. Added Glagolitic "round type"
	  font (Croation capitols only) from the collection of Croatian
	  fonts for LaTeX by Darko ZubriniÄ
	  ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/languages/croatian/
	  http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-1/tb50zubr.pdf Several
	  letters are missing besides the small letters.

2008-11-02 09:06 +0000 [r1038]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: A couple of Thai
	  references got obliqued twice.

2008-11-02 08:57 +0000 [r1037]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: By popular demand, removed
	  'ears' from Greek Upsilon and Psi. Copied resulting glyphs to
	  Serif Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.

2008-11-02 00:49 +0000 [r1036]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Some pointwise cleanup of main
	  Tamil range

2008-11-01 23:20 +0000 [r1035]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tried some things with lookups.
	  Didn't make much headway.

2008-11-01 22:34 +0000 [r1033-1034]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: somehow made a letter with wrong
	  width

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Added similar lookups and
	  ligatures to Thai ranges.

2008-11-01 18:34 +0000 [r1032]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Lookups now work no worse than
	  those for other Thai fonts, at least in Pango. Still perplexed by
	  behaviour of "Required" lookups.

2008-11-01 15:44 +0000 [r1031]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: For Thai, made ligatures and
	  lookups for yoying and thothan combined with a lower vowel. These
	  work well. Attempted looksups for saraaa with ru and lu, and for
	  saraam. Not working.

2008-10-31 23:54 +0000 [r1030]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Cleaned up a few of the Bengali
	  ligatures

2008-10-31 23:46 +0000 [r1029]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Tweek Thai

2008-10-31 22:48 +0000 [r1028]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fixed ligatures and mark
	  positioning for HanunÃ³o. Problem with ligatures: Gnome pango
	  doesn't do 'rlig', only 'liga'

2008-10-31 21:27 +0000 [r1027]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd: Changed lookup table
	  scripts for Devanagari and Bengali. Find Problems -> ATT found
	  several problems showing lookups acting on glyphs that weren't
	  listed in the script ranges, including dev2, bng2 (why not deva
	  and beng, I don't know). danda and doubledanda of Devanagari I
	  understand are to be shared among Indic scripts. So included bng2
	  and dev2 in the 'aalt' table for those. The 'init' and 'half'
	  tables for Bengali made active for bng2. The 'locl' table for
	  Bengali didn't do anything I could see: It mapped the Devanagari
	  danda to itself, and the doubledanda to itself. Deleted.

2008-10-31 20:10 +0000 [r1026]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd: Cleaned up some kern
	  tables. adjustments of under 5 EM are invisible. Some others I
	  just didn't like. Some were putting a letter beneath another,
	  with is wrong.

2008-10-31 19:39 +0000 [r1025]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: Added Thai

2008-10-31 19:02 +0000 [r1024]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Changes to mark positioning
	  lookups, esp. in Italic. Widened numerals in Bold

2008-10-27 19:00 +0000 [r1023]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd: Tweeks regarding
	  Armenian and lookups

2008-10-27 18:48 +0000 [r1022]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd: Added Armenian ligatures
	  FB13-FB17 with lookups Also made a historical ligature ('hlig')
	  table for u+0587. Toward bug #15183: missing characters from
	  Armenian range (FreeSans, Bold)
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?15183

2008-10-27 09:17 +0000 [r1021]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd: Added Armenian ligatures,
	  lookups. Cleaned up contours.

2008-10-26 23:45 +0000 [r1020]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Added 5 Armenian ligatures to
	  U+FB13 â FB17, and made corresponding 'liga' lookup. Found
	  there one ligature u+0587 that according to
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet "in new
	  orthography the Ö character is not a typographical ligature
	  anymore, and must never be treated as such. It is a distinct
	  letter and has its place in the new alphabetic sequence." So
	  moved this out of the 'liga' lookup and into a new 'hlig' lookup.

2008-10-26 22:26 +0000 [r1019]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Lots of improvements to
	  Thai. Completely revised letter spacing in Italic, and fiddled
	  with combining marks in all. Still aren't working quite right,
	  especially in Italic. Still need to work over digits (in Bold
	  they aren't even bold yet)

2008-10-26 14:21 +0000 [r1018]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Bold Thai : added
	  (painstakingly) constructed glyphs, lookups roman Thai: tweeks
	  Italic Thai: tweeks (Note this still has multiple problems)

2008-10-25 08:26 +0000 [r1017]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: WAZU says
	  http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Hanunoo.html MPH 2B Damase
	  doesn't support the consonant-vowel ligatures necessary to render
	  Buhid writing. OK, so I made 'mark' lookups for combining marks
	  and a bunch of ligatures in an 'rlig' lookup. The latter still
	  not working: don't know why. Made page to match the example of
	  the combining forms at
	  http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm

2008-10-24 21:56 +0000 [r1016]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Removed some marks from
	  Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols

2008-10-24 08:13 +0000 [r1015]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tweeked combining marks for
	  Vietnamese. Made to satisfy WAZU JAPAN Comprehensive Unicode Test
	  Page for Vietnamese / Quá»c Ngá»¯
	  http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Vietnamese.html Could still use
	  some tweeking...

2008-10-24 07:25 +0000 [r1014]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added marks for composition of
	  Vietnamese

2008-10-23 22:03 +0000 [r1013]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Put "below" combining mark on
	  lots of vowels and derivatives, for Vietnamese. Named a bunch of
	  composit Latin, expecting to make substitutions.

2008-10-23 20:14 +0000 [r1012]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Thai spacing alterations based
	  on advice of a native speaker.

2008-10-22 06:30 +0000 [r1011]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: re-named Thai lookups according
	  to order

2008-10-21 21:28 +0000 [r1010]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Cleanup of glyphs in Gujarati,
	  Devanagari. Note: Serious problem with Sans GPOS abvm in
	  Devanagari "'abvm' Above Base Mark in Devanagari subtable"
	  "gujr-0" But all the characters that list gujr-0 are in Gujarati.
	  Not sure how this got broken or how to fix it.

2008-10-21 19:32 +0000 [r1009]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fiddled with Thai mark
	  positioning: passes my tests now OK. Made a few more references
	  in Math Symbols; more regularization of stroke.

2008-10-21 09:01 +0000 [r1008]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added mark class for Vietnamese
	  "horn" Several references made in General Punctuation, Arrows

	* FreeMono.sfd: added some Combining Diacritical
	  Marks

2008-10-20 18:41 +0000 [r1006]  Stevan_White:

	  tweeks in Mathematical Symbols.

2008-10-19 18:30 +0000 [r1002]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Fiddling with Mathematical

	  symbols in Mono and Sans to make a little more regular and
	  correspond better with TeX. Tweek of serif.

2008-10-19 14:47 +0000 [r999]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd: a few more improvements.
	  (One problem with the Mathematical Alphanumeric area is, one must
	  remember to change it any time another face is altered...)

2008-10-19 14:41 +0000 [r998]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansBold.sfd,

	  additions to Sans faces (mostly in Greek) from experience of
	  pasting into FreeSerif Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.

2008-10-19 14:37 +0000 [r997]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Replaced most of Mathematical
	  Alphanumeric Symbols roman italic bold (latin and greek) gothic
	  italic bold (latin and greek) typewriter and numerals with glyphs
	  from FreeFont. These were scaled to uniform height. Remains:

	  that from Rachana_04 found on Swathanthra Malayalam Computing
	  project page http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/smc/ Besides
	  scaling and converting to cubic, performed much clean-up of
	  glyphs, added an r2 character, and re-named a bunch of
	  characters.

2008-09-22 22:06 +0000 [r945]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Cleaup of some Bengali glyphs.

2008-09-21 15:34 +0000 [r936]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Wrote script to check
	  if glyph encodings were in stated ranges, fixed most
	  discrepancies. There were a bunch of incompletely deleted
	  characters in several faces. Sans: found several other problems
	  in the process Tamil Four slots labelled 0BDA-D have glyphs, not
	  in Unicode. also 0BE1 I think they are misplaced; added 0010 to
	  each of them Devanagari Slot labelled U+093B is not in
	  Unicode--can't find glyph: deleted likewise 094F (may have been
	  meant to be 0954) 0955, 0973-0976 0954 should be a combining
	  mark, but it appears on the wrong side of 0. 0971 was just
	  wrong--made into simple dot. 0972 is also wrong--made my own
	  Candra A. Gujarati Slots labelled 0AE4-5 are not in Unicode; seem
	  not to belong at all. Deleted. 2800 is a dup of 2790. Deleted
	  Serif: phillipine_double u1736 was misplaced A bunch of the Math
	  Alphanumeric symbols are empty in the standard, because they're
	  represented elsewhere. These should be deleted (TO DO) First need
	  to make style consistent with existing symbols.

2008-09-21 11:41 +0000 [r935]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Applied patch from Daniel J

	  problems

2008-09-19 22:54 +0000 [r932]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/checkGlyphNumbers.py: included other Private
	  Use Ranges

2008-09-19 20:48 +0000 [r931]  Stevan_White:

	  to check that glyph numbers match Unicode (with complication)

2008-09-19 20:36 +0000 [r930]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/ranges.py: corrected and simplified
	  calculation of whether OS/2 bit is set. Now works mostly
	  perfectly, except for some high Unicode ranges...

2008-09-19 20:25 +0000 [r928-929]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added several Hebrew Alphabetic
	  Presentation Forms (some easy ones), to make its coverage the
	  same as Serif Bold.

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Re-encoded. Deleted several
	  glyphs in Hebrew Alphabetic Presentation Forms that didn't
	  correspond valid Unicode

2008-09-19 20:19 +0000 [r927]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd: Ran script to find
	  mis-numbered glyphs. Several were simply typos, some offset by
	  one.

2008-09-19 20:13 +0000 [r926]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd: Numerous cases of glyphs
	  in Private Use area incorrectly assigned Unicode numbers and
	  names. Gave all -1 for Unicode and named like "slot.XXXX".

2008-09-19 09:51 +0000 [r921-925]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/GenerateOpenType: Made to output old-style
	  kerning tables for Windows (FontForge complains though)

	* tools/GenerateTrueType: Made to hint before
	  instructing: FontForge bases TT instructions on hints although
	  hints are not put into TrueType fonts.

	* tools/hex_range.py: cosmetic tweek

	* tools/isMonoMono.py: re-worked to take a list of
	  files as input

	* tools/ranges.py: re-structured code and corrected
	  a few ranges

2008-09-19 09:17 +0000 [r920]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Adapted Mahjong Tiles from
	  George Douros' Unicode Symbols font.

2008-09-18 23:27 +0000 [r919]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added Domino Tiles. Domino
	  outline is copied from George Douros' Unicode Symbols, but the
	  rest I preferred to do with references.

2008-09-18 21:30 +0000 [r918]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Adapted Mathematical
	  Alphanumeric Symbols from George Douros' Unicode Symbols font.

2008-09-18 21:02 +0000 [r917]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: This one got away
	  from me--I don't know what I did. Looks like some small contour
	  edits.

2008-09-18 20:58 +0000 [r915-916]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd: Fixed one mis-numberd
	  character in Latin Extended-B

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Fixed several mis-numbered
	  characters.

2008-09-18 20:13 +0000 [r914]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd: SansBold: one Georgian
	  letter with no name, one Zapf Dingbat was unnumbered ATT test
	  shows a bunch of problems with Gurmukhi and 'blwf' table indeed
	  shows those letters at 0x10000+ Sans names them like
	  uni0A30_uni0A4D.blwf: they are in range ECC6 to ED06 I meant to
	  move this range into Private Use in last release, and missed it.
	  So now it is moved, into same range as Sans. Both Sans and
	  SansBold in nukt table for Gurmukhi have duplicate entries for
	  uni0A15 uni0A3C. Deleted dups.

2008-09-18 19:05 +0000 [r913]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd: fixed a number of
	  Unassigned Code Points in Greek Extended

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd: mis-numbered Combining
	  Diacritics

2008-09-18 18:24 +0000 [r911]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd: Several chars in Latin
	  Extended hadn't been named. One spurious letter in Letterlike
	  Symbols

2008-09-16 19:37 +0000 [r910]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Lots of additions: unless
	  otherwise noted, they are from George Duros' fonts Analecta,
	  Music, and Unicode (haven't got final confirmation of the
	  eligibility of these glyphs, so this is just for testing.) Added
	  some combining marks, fiddled a bit. In both Serif & Mono, tried
	  to get a key symbol characters to fit inside the key combining
	  mark Serif Got rid of ears on Upsilon Added: Gothic Western &
	  Byzantine Musical Symbols Misc Symbols, Misc Technical Symbols
	  (also drew many myself) Supplemental Symbols and Arrows Mono
	  Added: lotsa Misc Technical Symbols OCR Symbols drew many
	  Supplemental Symbols and Arrows, Misc Technical Sans Added
	  Phoenecian Made a few Letterlike Symbols; Made Re and Im to be
	  sans-serif.

2008-09-11 20:49 +0000 [r908]  Stevan_White:

	* ChangeLog: changes since June

2008-09-11 20:42 +0000 [r907]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Removed pointless entries from
	  Latin kern table Tidied points in Sinhala

2008-09-07 21:47 +0000 [r906]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Tidied up Tamil ligatures
	  EEA8-EEAB to fix TT build warning "MonotonicFindAlong: Never
	  found our spline."

2008-09-07 21:07 +0000 [r905]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  sfd/Makefile, FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Added APL characters
	  to FreeMono (why?...) Fixed several last-minute problems,
	  including Serif: Tweeked GPOS mark table for Cyrillic Sans: Added
	  a GPOS table for Cyrillic (but several diacritics are missing)
	  Serif, Mono: tweeked some bugs in extensible brackets & integrals
	  Serif: Vietnamese o circumflex: accent was a bit high. fixed.
	  MonoBoldOblique OTF build uni213b intersects self Generation of
	  TT fonts complains about several things to stderr, including
	  SerifBold: "There exists a 'fpgm' code that seems incompatible
	  with FontForge's. Instructions generated will be of lower
	  quality. If legacy hinting is to be scrapped, it is suggested to
	  clear the `fpgm` and repeat autoinstructing. It will be then
	  possible to append user's code to FontForge's 'fpgm', but due to
	  possible future updates, it is extremely advised to use high
	  numbers for user's functions." (probably has been there since I
	  first copied the TT instructions in. ) Just repeated the copying
	  process carefully, and the warning went away. Serif:
	  "FindMatchingHVEdge fell into an impossible position" fixed a
	  bunch of point too close REMAINING PROBLEM in Serif TT build
	  "MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline." fixed several bad
	  TT matrices-- there are several more fixed many "control points
	  too close" no luck

2008-09-03 08:43 +0000 [r904]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd: Added/corrected some
	  Misc. Symbols by copying from Serif. Note this is only a stopgap
	  solution. Want real sans-serif symbols.

2008-09-02 22:41 +0000 [r903]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,

	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Put in minimal
	  Miscellaneous Symbols: Card suites and some musical notes. Note
	  not very happy with shapes...some I just drew. Sans isn't really
	  sans. Fixed one APL symbol in Mono so it verified in OTF version

2008-08-31 11:39 +0000 [r902]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Built set of APL symbols.

2008-08-30 18:37 +0000 [r901]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Un-linked references in uni02B2
	  and uni02B5, because when validating the TrueType version,
	  fontforge gave an error "is drawn in wrong direction". (I suspect
	  a bug in fontforge. Other similar glyphs make no errors.)

2008-08-30 16:23 +0000 [r900]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fixed missing extrema in
	  TrueType. These were the last cases being reported by validate in
	  all the faces.

2008-08-30 13:46 +0000 [r899]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd: fixed last missing
	  extrema in TrueType

2008-08-30 11:02 +0000 [r898]  Stevan_White:

	* sfd/Makefile, Makefile,
	  tools/validate.py,
	  tools/isMonoMono.py: restructured validation to
	  look in a directory

2008-08-30 10:57 +0000 [r897]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Fixed missing extrema in
	  TrueType versions

2008-08-30 09:31 +0000 [r894-896]  Stevan_White:

	* AUTHORS, CREDITS: unified style

	* README: lots of re-wording, concerning goals and
	  purposes

	* INSTALL: Got rid of outline style, tried to make a
	  little more appealing.

2008-08-14 22:01 +0000 [r893]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Same problem with uni0A83 as
	  with bn_llikaar. Just made zero-width.

2008-08-14 20:29 +0000 [r892]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd: Glyph bn_llikaar, U+09E3
	  BENGALI VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC LL, has right bound positioned far
	  into the negative. Causes a warning in fontforge when opening OTF
	  version. Comparing with other fonts supporting Bengali, found no
	  others that do this. FreeSerif makes glyph width 0 (which sounds
	  right according to Unicode) and puts glyph wholly to left of 0.
	  However, I haven't found this letter in text anywhere. I wonder
	  if it is really used in writing.

2008-08-14 07:41 +0000 [r891]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Further TrueType validation
	  fixes. Sans still has two glyps in wrong direction.

2008-08-13 23:09 +0000 [r890]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Fixed more TrueType
	  problems...all with missing extrema in TTF validation

2008-08-13 21:35 +0000 [r889]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: fixed all the TrueType
	  validation problems of type "intersects itself" and all but two
	  of the "wrong directions", as well as a lot of "missing extrema".
	  But there remain hundreds of missing extrema in the TrueType
	  version. Also, bn_llikaar in Sans and Oblique still has a problem
	  in OTF version.

2008-08-12 22:21 +0000 [r888]  Stevan_White:

	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Made .ttf files to
	  validate. Other faces have many more problems still.

2008-08-12 20:41 +0000 [r887]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/GenerateTrueType: For TrueType, one puts in
	  Instructions, not Hints. This vastly improves look of TrueType
	  fonts in Windows.

2008-08-11 23:07 +0000 [r886]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd: Continuing to make OTF
	  versions validate. * FreeMonoOblique.sfd: lots of missing points
	  at extrema * FreeSerif.sfd 12 wrong directions, 1 missing extrema
	  * FreeSerifItalic.sfd many missing points at extrema, 1
	  self-intersecting What was wrong: in several oblique cases, an
	  already-italic glyph was made more italic, thereby fouling up
	  extrema (although why it passed validation in the SFD I don't
	  know). Some glyphs were overly-complicated with many near points.
	  Cleaned up, rounded to int. Remaining problem: OTF
	  FreeSansOblique FreeSans. one Bengali glyph in each whose advance
	  width and htmx don't match. Moral of story: validate the OTF and
	  TTF versions too before a release.

2008-08-11 22:59 +0000 [r885]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd: Reverse a mistake from
	  last commit: somehow this file was converted to quadratic, or
	  something.

2008-08-10 22:25 +0000 [r884]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Found that SFD files
	  that validated produced OpenType files that don't. These
	  represent the easy fixes. Some were result of conversion to
	  quadratic; some shouldn't have validated in the SFD... *
	  MonoBoldOblique: uni0250 missing pts at extrema [reference glyph
	  rotated...] * Sans: uni0AC4 wrong direction [simplified, rounded
	  to int] * SansOblique: uni01EA wrong direction [rounded to int] *
	  SerifBold: uni023f wrong direction [round to int] *
	  SerifBoldItalic: uni0245 missing pts at extrema [ungrouped ref,

	  OpenType added some ranges fixed bug with ranges outside of font

	* CREDITS: 3 new ranges

2008-06-22 07:53 +0000 [r878]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Cyrillic: tweeked accents for
	  consistency, and for readability in small sizes.

2008-06-21 23:31 +0000 [r877]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Thanna range: tweeking

2008-06-21 23:15 +0000 [r876]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Thaana range: Scaled up by
	  about 15%, raised by 100EM, tightened some of the diacritics to
	  get inside 900 to -300 EM limits.

2008-06-21 22:21 +0000 [r875]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Added Old Persian and Ugaritic
	  from MPH2BDamase font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Added Tai Le range adapted from
	  MPH2BDamase font.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Added some ancient Greek
	  numerals from Tempora to high Unicode area, (partly just to show
	  it can now be done.)

2008-06-21 15:51 +0000 [r871-872]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd: Couple of tweeks putting
	  glyphs above -300EM.

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Surgery to Thai letter 'tho
	  than', u+0e10, to push it above -300 EM. This makes Thai range
	  completely between 900 and -300 EM.

2008-06-21 11:20 +0000 [r870]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Many auxilary characters (esp.
	  for Malayalam, Bengla, and Tamil) representing ligatures and
	  alternative forms without their own Unicode, were moved from
	  ranges above 0xFFFF (which ought to have been slots for other
	  defined Unicode ranges) into the Private Use area. In Serif, I
	  segregated the scripts, in Sans it was hard to see where one
	  began and another ended, so I moved them en masse. Note several
	  problems with wrongly-named characters: I already re-named
	  glyph570 and glyph582. But there are others with names starting
	  with A...

2008-06-21 11:08 +0000 [r869]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd: Fixed (I hope the last)
	  problem with scripts in lookups Find Problems -> ATT (all
	  selected) finds multiple issues, SansBold In addition to script
	  'guru', added 'gur2' to the scripts for these lookups 'nukt'
	  Nukta forms in Gurmukhi 'blwf' Below Base Forms in Gurmukhi
	  'pstf' Post Base Forms in Gurmukhi 'blws' Below Base
	  Substitutions in Gurmukhi 'abvs' Above Base Substitutions in
	  Gurmukhi 'psts' Post Base Substitutions in Gurmukhi SansOblique
	  In addition to script 'beng', added 'bng2' to the scripts for the
	  lookup 'half' Half Forms in Bengali Moreover, the lookup 'aalt'
	  Access All Alternates in Latin contains only Bengali letters.
	  Re-named as Bengali, made to work on beng, bng2 scripts

2008-06-20 21:52 +0000 [r868]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Scaled Sinhala range. Remedies
	  bug #23656: Sinhala letters over-sized

2008-06-20 18:03 +0000 [r867]  Stevan_White:

	  Greek Extended accents again. re-positioned ypogegrammani on
	  advice of Alexey Kryukov Put prosgegrammani beneath main letters
	  in Mono, to make narrower glyphs Implemented more distinction
	  between tonos and acute.

2008-06-19 08:25 +0000 [r866]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Completed fit of Mono
	  to 800 to -200 EM.

2008-06-19 07:47 +0000 [r865]  Stevan_White:

2008-06-19 07:40 +0000 [r864]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd: Now Mono Oblique, as well
	  as roman and Bold, are within 800 to -200 EM. Just BoldOblique to
	  go.

2008-06-19 07:25 +0000 [r863]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd: More toward fitting to 800
	  to -200 EM. Basically, reduced Georgian by 92%. Also made an
	  over-all offset, so Georgian is somehow centered (Bold...I guess
	  I already did this in roman). Want to also do an emboldening to
	  make stroke like rest of font, but current FontForge has a nasty
	  crash that loses data on this function.

2008-06-19 06:19 +0000 [r862]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: In effort to make fit in 800 to
	  -200 EM, Scaled Georgian by 92%, centered on 600 wide box. Next:
	  Embolden a bit.

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Toward making all
	  glyphs lie between -200 and 800 EM. Numerous small changes,
	  especially raising descenders of some Hebrew letters. Georgian
	  remains a problem

2008-06-13 07:39 +0000 [r860]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Moved prosgegrammeni up to

2008-06-11 17:57 +0000 [r858]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: More fiddling with Greek
	  Extended accents

2008-06-11 07:43 +0000 [r857]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,

2008-06-10 08:00 +0000 [r856]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Fixed a few big horizontal

2008-06-09 23:12 +0000 [r855]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Implemented TemporaLCGUni
	  glyphs in Cyrillic ranges. Added a breve_cyrillic for the
	  moustache breve mark.

2008-06-08 08:45 +0000 [r854]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Replaced most of Cyrillic range
	  with TemporaLGCUni. Remodelled many of the derived Cyrillic
	  characters after these. Fiddled globally with spacing of small
	  letters. Unclear on diacritics 485-6, unhappy with breve.

2008-06-07 23:12 +0000 [r853]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Started implementing
	  TemporaLCGUni in Greek ranges. Replaced 3DC-3E1 from Tempora,
	  because I thought they looked nicer and more like the other
	  existing FreeFont glyphs. Replaced 3DA-B from Tempora, because
	  they look more like Unicode samples, and nicer. Added 03f3-4,
	  03F7-F. Prefer my own lunate epsilon. Replaced Phi and Omega from
	  Tempora. These plainly fit the other FreeFont glyphs better than
	  the origninals. (How did this happen?) In bold, replaced U+03D7
	  Copied lbbar u+2114 Small italic greek: replaced most except phi,
	  psi, omega Based on new information, broke the identification of
	  oxia with Latin acute.

	  array are disordered Elements in BlueValues/OtherBlues array are
	  too close (Change BlueFuzz) StemSnapV does not contain StdVW
	  value. So I ordered the array, and based on other slanted fonts,
	  removed StemSnapV. Note however, I still think the two top Blues
	  lines are too close But I don't even know what the second-to-top
	  line is meant to do.

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: Deleted the single Arabic

2008-05-11 10:56 +0000 [r796-798]  Stevan_White:

2008-05-10 13:44 +0000 [r790]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Deleted ranges for Oriya,
	  Kannada, on account of 1) they only contained a subset of the
	  consonant glyphs of the scripts, few if any vowels, and had no
	  ligature lookups as required 2) Kannada was based on the Akurti
	  fonts, which have copyright issues. See bug #23225: Oriya range
	  only partial bug #23224: Kannada range only partial

2008-05-09 07:49 +0000 [r789]  Stevan_White:

	  range missing many characters; many wrong

2008-05-09 05:22 +0000 [r787]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Got a copy of the original
	  Tikkana font, Copied in remaining consonants and vowels that I
	  could find there. I think one vowel 0C55 is missing according to
	  unicode). Strangely, the Telugu digits are alo missing. In
	  Tikkana, the default "checkmark" structural mark is missing from
	  many consonants, according to Unicode, but is a separate glyph. I
	  put the checkmark on. This, and scaled up by 150% and cleaned up
	  intersecting glyphs and many unnecessary points.

2008-05-07 22:38 +0000 [r786]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Filled out Telugu consonants.

	  the maintainer of that font,
	  http://packages.debian.org/sid/ttf-mph-2b-damase Glyphs are

	  are pretty rough, clearly a digitization of handwriting. I just
	  cleaned them up, and corrected discrepancies with Unicode, and

2008-04-28 22:15 +0000 [r752]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Much fiddling with Tamil range.
	  First scaled to 78% (avoiding the references) This gets it in the
	  ballpark height-wise. [A bit taller than the Latin letters, but

	* FreeSerif.sfd: * Many changes to Thai, trying
	  to make the script fit between some lines, so accents won't get
	  clipped, etc. Also, stroke weight was heavier than that of Latin.
	  Scaled whole thing by 93%. Shrank the tallest letters 0E42-4 to
	  get them under 900EM. Shaved off top of maiek. Fiddled with
	  positioning of all accents. Made positioning tables for accents.
	  [note, unclear these are working correctly] * Fixed a bug having

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Revisited Latin-1 and
	  Latin-A accents. Glyph B7 was called "periodcentered", but
	  Unicode callse it Mid Dot, and the description doesn't refer to
	  the period. I made it like the dot accent. throughout, and
	  referred L-dot to it. Also double-checked "commaaccent"
	  characters (some in Unicode called cedilla, but the Unicode
	  example shows a comma...mystery) also the funny IPA upside-down f
	  often had two bars, incorrectly. To do: go through rest of Serif,
	  and Sans

2008-04-08 23:25 +0000 [r696]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Completed
	  re-structuring of stacked Latin accents in Mono. Also: lots of
	  associated adjustments of Greek Extended accents. (Trying to at
	  least center extremely wide characters on their box) Repaired
	  some victems of "find overlaps" sweeps Worked on glyphs with
	  apostrope/comma parts Corrected a few wrong glyphs. Trying out a
	  "bent quotes" solution to making primes distinct from quotes.

2008-04-08 09:56 +0000 [r695]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd: Toward reducing overall
	  height Did similar process as for Mono, fixing a few errors along
	  the way. Also the Greek Extended range was very messed up
	  vertical and horizontally. Horizonal spacing of the heavily
	  accented Greek is a real problem in Mono... To do: revisit
	  "commaaccent" characters in all faces: do some have cedillas?
	  some Hebrew glyphs are a little low Georgian generally is way out
	  of bounds

2008-04-07 07:18 +0000 [r694]  Stevan_White:

	* INSTALL: various updates and corrections, tweeked

	  FreeMonoBold.sfd to make Latin ranges lie between 800 and -200
	  EM, as with FreeMono.

2008-04-06 16:20 +0000 [r691]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/hex_range.py (added): a tool for printing
	  out ranges of formatted hex numbers

2008-04-06 12:33 +0000 [r690]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Latin Extended ranges:
	  Implemented new policy of shortening the letters of the
	  characters with the highest-stacked accents. At this point all
	  the Latin glyphs lie betweeen 800 and -200 EM. Also checked for
	  readability of all the Latin extended letters in xterm. (Issue:
	  it chops letters outside their bounding boxes; many accents had
	  been a bit outside. Made sure that if they were chopped, they
	  were at least still recognizable.)

2008-04-05 19:41 +0000 [r689]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Following exchange about Mono on
	  freefont-bugs with Joe Wells, who * doesn't like the curly quote
	  marks * wants combining diacritics to work * wants tight line
	  spacing Trying to reduce font height: * exclamdown was below -200
	  * Throughout Extended Greek, ypogegrammeni were too low.
	  Shortened glyph, and raised all references. * Lots of messing
	  with Latin Extended ranges to make glyphs mostly fit into 800
	  height. Mostly succeeded. A couple will get chopped. * Messed
	  with "commaaccent" glyphs, which were very low * Cyrillic 04B1
	  had a tail that was incorrectly low * Much mucking with Georgian
	  range. Moved up by 95 (read Georgian is written as though
	  centered between two horizontal lines, rather than as sitting on
	  a baseline) There are still a few very high glyphs. FontForge
	  U+0122 called Gcommaaccent, glyph looks like that, but Unicode
	  says it's Gcedilla. Made the ones called cedilla by Unicode to be
	  cedillas Note bug in Unicode: standard for 0122, 0123, 0136,
	  0137, 013B, 013C, 0145, 0146, 0156, 0157 all talk about cedilla,
	  say to make it with cedilla, but example shows comma. By the way:
	  * Got rid of commaaccent and dotlessj in Corporate Use * Replaced
	  shadedark, with little squares now not overlapping. * Corrected
	  IPA symbol 'ts' 02A6, added 02a8, 02a9, 02aa, 02ab, 02ac, 02ad,
	  02ae, 02af (so many changes...the CVS server was down...)

2008-04-05 18:18 +0000 [r688]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: e-named arabic and hebrew
	  characters Big adjustment to comma-accents. Mostly effects Greek
	  Extended. Made such accents to be like comma, rather than like
	  Russian apostrophe (and de-referenced that symbol)

2008-04-04 07:17 +0000 [r687]  Stevan_White:

	  Cyrillic oblique... https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?17912
	  It looked like chaos to me. Only so much can be done: the font is
	  flawed. But I think the changes make text readable in these
	  faces. There were many dozens of incorrect glyphs in
	  higher-numbered characters. It looked like someone started
	  copying letters that were like the correct ones, meaning to edit
	  them later, but never got around to it. (Or else, a facile
	  copying of glyphs that kinda looked right, but really kinda
	  weren't.) I deleted all those I could find. No glyph is better
	  than a wrong glyph. Futzt with accents, shooting for consistency
	  and readability. A maintenance thing: making correct references
	  (acyrillic vs a, although they may be the same glyph) I made a
	  lot of headway, but it isn't finished. Likewise, a large fraction
	  of these are compound characters, which can be made with
	  references, resulting in easier maintenance, reduced likelihood
	  of errors, and smaller files. I replaced many.

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: Cyrillic italic Added

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Overhaul of Cyrillic
	  Italic, BoldItalic added small yat for bug #22588 (note Times New
	  Roman doesn't use alternate form in Italic) All forms of Serif
	  have big problems in Cyrillic. The ugliest is in roman. The
	  letters, even of the Russian alphabet, are of inconsistent height
	  (awfully, small 0438 (ii) 0446 (tse)) and they vary from the
	  height of Latin and they vary from the height of italic and bold.
	  They are a mish-mash of letters from several fonts, of similar
	  (but not quite identical) weight, and similar, (but not quite
	  identical) size. I think the best solution would be to identify
	  the face that best matches Latin, and fill the range with that. I
	  think this is possible because the rarer letters seem to be
	  better: the common letters are the ones that are wrong. For now,
	  I just increased the sized of 0438 and 0446, and 048a, 048b, also
	  0459 (lje) 045A (nje) 0464 (dje) Other issues ------------ Were
	  outline, with home-made accents - replaced with references 0400
	  (was referencing E) 0401, 0402, 040c, 040d, 040e 0450, 0451, 0453
	  more in the later ranges. Deleted dozens of characters in Bold,
	  Italic, and BoldItalic, that appeared half-made (a part of the
	  letter was copied, but the letter was never completed, and was
	  basically wrong) Lots of letters with hooks and lines in italic
	  were represented as just the unhooked version in italic. 048a,
	  048b (short i with tail, had big-eared breve common in Cyrillic,
	  but unlike other letters) Re-implemented many compound letters
	  with references. Questionable ------------ In all versions,
	  0478-9 Uk, uk. SerifItalic 0495 Small ge with acute, in italic:
	  is it like italic ge, or oblique? Well, peeked at Times New
	  Roman, which has it oblique.

2008-03-23 18:04 +0000 [r650]  Stevan_White:

	* ChangeLog: additions for last few days

2008-03-23 14:21 +0000 [r649]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: last problem with Find Problems
	  -> ATT 'mark' Latin lookup afii10026 is in 'cyrl', also afii10074
	  (These are upper and lower Cyrillic i) [Just removed mark from
	  both letters] 'half' Bengali lookup Khanda_Ta is in 'bng2' [added
	  bng2 to lookup]

2008-03-23 13:28 +0000 [r648]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: added TtTable etc

2008-03-23 13:15 +0000 [r647]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: clean-up of Points too Close
	  through to end of font. This episode completes the paths/points
	  clean-up of Serif. (But note: many ranges, esp. Ethiopic,
	  Japanese, and Indic, have way too many points, resulting in
	  lumpiness.)

2008-03-23 12:03 +0000 [r646]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: clean-up of Points too Close
	  though Arabic

2008-03-23 11:50 +0000 [r645]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: clean-up of Points too Close
	  through Hiragana and Katakana

2008-03-22 14:43 +0000 [r644]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: Mostly additions to FreeSans,
	  mostly having to do with LaTeX ranges. This basically fills the
	  LaTeX range for FreeSans, except for extensible brackets etc.

2008-03-21 23:49 +0000 [r642-643]  Stevan_White:

	* Makefile: split Makefile into two levels

	* sfd/Makefile (added): tidier with a lower-level
	  makefile

2008-03-21 21:51 +0000 [r641]  Stevan_White:

	* Makefile: made quieter

2008-03-21 20:57 +0000 [r640]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: in previous commit, hadn't
	  relly saved the changes about the ligature tables. this does that
	  also, named the "ciel" and "floor" characters

2008-03-21 20:50 +0000 [r636-639]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: (these changes were also
	  made in the previous few commits of other faces) changed name of
	  00B5 from 'mu' to 'micro' changed name of 2206 from 'Delta' to
	  'Delta.math' changed name of 0308 from 'diaerisis' to
	  'diaerisiscomb'

	* FreeSerif.sfd: split lookup for ligatures in
	  latin into two classes; ff, ffl, fl which are appropriate for all
	  languages, and fi, ffi, which are not appropriate in Turkish (due
	  to distinction between short and long i)

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: moved dotlessj from
	  Corporate Use, deleted commaaccent there mis-named glyphs
	  tcommaaccent, Tcommaaccent changed name of 030A from 'dieresis'
	  to 'ringcomb'

	* FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd: removed bogus glyphs
	  for 200C 200D, ZWJ and ZWNJ (zero-width joiner, zero-width
	  non-joiner)

2008-03-21 20:20 +0000 [r633-635]  Stevan_White:

	* tools/ConvertFont (removed): this was apparently
	  an older version of GenerateTrueType

	* tools/GenerateTrueType: Took out scaling to 2048
	  (was there a good reason for that?) Made to first auto-hint whole
	  font

	* Makefile: made to work for me

2008-03-21 15:20 +0000 [r632]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd,
	  FreeMonoBold.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Regularized stacking of
	  accents in Latin Extended Additional

2008-03-21 15:09 +0000 [r631]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: everal characters in U+F600
	  Corporate Use range dotlessj, onefitted (and other "fitted"
	  numerals), commaaccent registered, copyright, trademark According
	  to "Adobe Glyph List"
	  http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/generic/t2/glyphlist.txt
	  Adobe "fitted" numerals used to go in the corporate use section
	  More in U+F800 range more corporate symbols represented elsewhere
	  math braces, brackets move some to 2300 range Now Serif has full
	  set extensible brackets in Miscellaneous Technical Also, think
	  I've filled out all of the IPA

2008-03-21 15:06 +0000 [r629-630]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Several additions to IPA
	  Regularized stacking of accents in Latin Extended Additional

	* FreeSans.sfd: egularized stacking of accents
	  in Latin Extended Additional Added some arrows Some Blackboard
	  Bold Several characters in U+F600 Corporate Use range dotlessj,
	  onefitted, commaaccent dotlessj referred to by: jcircumflex,
	  uni01F0: how to move it? (renamed it to uFFFF, re-linked others
	  by hand) commaaccent http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=9
	  should be u+0326 but wasn't linked to anything anyway

2008-03-21 15:01 +0000 [r628]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSansBold.sfd,
	  FreeSansOblique.sfd,
	  FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd: Got rid of dotlessi
	  etc single substitution and related ccmp table Regularized
	  stacking of accents in Latin Extended Additional FreeSansBold
	  U+0617 etc, read glyphs "4GWglm" It should be arabic. Deleted

2008-03-19 08:21 +0000 [r627]  Stevan_White:

	* ChangeLog: added changes of the 18th

2008-03-19 00:14 +0000 [r626]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: clean-up of all path issues and
	  points too close

2008-03-18 19:52 +0000 [r625]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Re-ordered the ShortTable,
	  because when I did autoinstruct on the quadratic version, it did
	  it this way.

2008-03-18 19:44 +0000 [r624]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: A ligature referred to a name
	  with no entry: afii301. This is the Adobe name for zero-width
	  joiner, U+200D. With this, FontForge's "Find Problems" ATT "Check
	  for missing glyph names" finally passes.

2008-03-18 19:41 +0000 [r623]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: zero-width joiner and zero-width
	  non-joiner both had glyphs, incorrectly. (u+200B 200C)

2008-03-18 19:33 +0000 [r622]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Seems one ot the 'pres' tables
	  contains mixed Devangari and Gujarati. This is probably a
	  mistake, but re-named the table accordingly, and added the
	  script. With this, FontForge "Find Problems" for ATT "Check for
	  missing scripts in features" finally passes.

2008-03-18 19:24 +0000 [r621]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: removed another 'above' mark
	  form a greek letter

2008-03-18 19:14 +0000 [r619-620]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Likewise a Gugarati lookup had
	  script DFLT.

	* FreeSans.sfd: 'pres' Pre Base Substitution has
	  script DFLT. That cannot be right: this contains Devangari
	  characters. Changed script and name accordingly. This was
	  probably a mistake and a leftover.

2008-03-18 19:07 +0000 [r618]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: got rid of "lookup \d\d" in
	  table names

2008-03-18 19:01 +0000 [r617]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: The 'aalt' table for Latin
	  contains only bengali characters. [renamed accordingly, and put
	  in script 'beng' rather than 'latn'] The table "Ligature
	  Substitution for Devanagari lookup 46" is really a 'reph'.
	  Re-named accordingly. The table "'vatu' Vattu Variants lookup 24"
	  is in script 'DFLT', which is wrong. The characters are from
	  Gujarati. But there is already such a table for Gujarati. Changed
	  name and script accordingly. Got rid of Single Substitution
	  table.

2008-03-18 18:54 +0000 [r616]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Think I fixed the problem
	  causing the FontForge crashes. Related to the dotlessi thing.
	  There's a table Lookup: 6 0 0 "'ccmp' Glyph
	  Composition/Decomposition in Latin lookup 0" {"'ccmp' Glyph
	  Composition/Decomposition in Latin lookup 0 subtable" } ['ccmp'
	  ('latn' <'dflt' > ) ] It is related to another lookup ChainSub2:
	  class "'ccmp' Glyph Composition/Decomposition in Latin lookup 0
	  subtable" that has something to do with i and j. It ends with
	  SeqLookup: 0 "Single Substitution lookup 47" EndFPST When I
	  removed the lookup for i and j, the SeqLookup line would be badly
	  corrupted, and subsequent saves resulted in a segfault and a
	  truncated sfd file. So I doctored the whole thing with vi.

2008-03-18 08:13 +0000 [r615]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Again got rid of single
	  substitution lookup changing dotlessi and dotlessj to i and j,
	  because it's wrong.

2008-03-18 08:10 +0000 [r614]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Regress to 1.118. Somehow
	  introduced a crash. (I wasn't careful enough changing the names
	  of the lookups, I think--need to make sure the change results in
	  unique names).

2008-03-17 23:36 +0000 [r613]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: got rid of single substiturions
	  of dotlessi dotlessj for i and j. these were just wrong. the
	  'aalt' table only contained Bengali, although it said 'latn' and
	  its name was Latin. Changed name and script to correct. Got rid
	  of extra Devanagari vatu table

2008-03-17 23:30 +0000 [r612]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: got rid of 'lookup xx' in table
	  names

2008-03-17 23:26 +0000 [r611]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Removed 'mark' named 'above'
	  from some Greek and Cyrillic letters, and corrected it for a
	  couple of diacriticals.

2008-03-16 20:32 +0000 [r609-610]  Stevan_White:

	* CREDITS: clean-up of non-unicode characters

	* CREDITS: converted to UTF-8

2008-03-16 20:18 +0000 [r608]  Stevan_White:

	* AUTHORS: changed name of maintainer to mine

2008-03-16 20:09 +0000 [r607]  Stevan_White:

	* ChangeLog: compiled changes from CVS log. this is
	  a messy process. I'm sure I missed a lot. Meant to represent
	  changes since 02/10.

2008-03-16 17:29 +0000 [r606]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd,
	  FreeSans.sfd, FreeMono.sfd,
	  FreeMonoOblique.sfd: clean-up named some
	  unnamed characters removed a duplicate

2008-03-16 13:34 +0000 [r605]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Added vowels to GPOS 'mark'
	  lookup table for 'above' added 'below' as well, but only for
	  c-cedilla

2008-03-16 12:11 +0000 [r604]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Much futzing with accents in
	  Latin extensions, in attempt to make them readable at small
	  sizes, and to make the glyph bounds reasonable. Note:
	  A-ring-acute is a silly character.

2008-03-15 23:16 +0000 [r603]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: path clean-up up to points too
	  close passes Validation

2008-03-15 22:43 +0000 [r602]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: clean-up of path
	  problems up to points too close

2008-03-15 22:19 +0000 [r601]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd: Made to Validate
	  Added points at extrema

2008-03-15 21:59 +0000 [r600]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Changed names of a bunch of
	  glyphs with invalid TrueType names, in response to failed
	  Validation, and in Windows the font not showing up in the font
	  display. These were all in the range 0x1025f+, which is an
	  attempt to take care of combining forms in Indic scripts (I don't
	  know if this work was ever completed, or if it is the best way to
	  do this). The names were like uni0916_uni094D.half_uni0928.pres
	  or longer uni0926_uni094D.half_uni0926_uni094D.half.pres and a
	  few much longer than this. By a process of removing redundant
	  information, I think I preserved what information was there.
	  There were a few more names that were never filled in, but
	  contained a minus, which isn't valid. These start with
	  "nonunicode", and I replaced the minus with an underscore.

2008-03-15 19:55 +0000 [r599]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: some futzing with Combining
	  Diacriticals

2008-03-15 19:50 +0000 [r597-598]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd: changed WinInfo

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd: added TtTable

2008-03-15 16:12 +0000 [r596]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Fixed several lookup issues,
	  based on "Find Problems". TamlCA_TamlSSA.half with ligature from
	  lookup subtable 'haln' Halant Forms in Tamil lookup 24 subtable
	  refers to a missing glyph glyph190 Similar complaint with a
	  'half' lookup. For this and the other glyph190 issue, I changed
	  glyph190 to TamlCA_TamlSSA, which looks right according to its
	  surroundings. The lookup 'aalt' Access All Alternatives i is
	  active for glyph bn_ekaar which has script 'bng2', yet this
	  script does not appear in any of the features which apply the
	  lookup. Similar complaint about bn_aikaar. For this I changed the
	  script of the lookup to bng2, and changed the name of the lookup
	  accordingly. The lookup 'liga' standard Ligatures look is active
	  for glyph uni0937091F which has script 'dev2', yet this script
	  does not appear in any of the features which apply the lookup. It
	  makes a ligature of uni0937 and uni091F, which are in Devangari.
	  So I changed the script of the lookup to 'dev2' and changed the
	  name of the lookup accordingly. Also shortened the names of many
	  of the lookup tables.

2008-03-15 13:22 +0000 [r593]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd,
	  FreeSerif.sfd: CJK punctuation: made some of
	  the very high glyphs smaller (under 900EM) The brackets in Sans
	  were very ugly, and not even Sans-serif. Serif: added extensible
	  square brackets, diddled with integral corrected direction of
	  some added glyphs

	  to FontForge Validate complaint, in hopes of making font work in
	  Windows.

2008-03-12 22:45 +0000 [r566]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeMono.sfd: Copied in by hand TrueType
	  tables from a version with quadratic splines. I hope this will
	  make the glyphs smooth properly in Windows.

2008-03-12 22:41 +0000 [r565]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSans.sfd: Added TrueType tables (copied in

2008-03-06 18:58 +0000 [r536]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Shortened and thickened the

	* FreeSerif.sfd: Some modifications to Spacing
	  Modifier Letters 02B0 - 02FF Idea was to bring in line with
	  Unicode that suggests that these characters should all occupy the
	  width of a space in the font, here, 250 EM. Unfortunate
	  side-effects in hundreds of characters that used them. Hope I got

	* FreeMono.sfd: Completed fix of glyph path
	  problems open path intersecting not clockwise missing extrema Had
	  to remove one glyph, because couldn't figure out how to make it
	  not intersect itself: dkshade U+2193, a checkerboard (probably
	  should be re-done as non-intersecting squares). Also, lowered the
	  diacritics on a bunch of capital Latin letters, so they didn't
	  have to intersect when stacked. Act of desperation?

	  Intersecting Paths Check outermost paths clockwise With Check
	  missing extrema there were lots of problems, and it's very

	  Indian scripts. Note: Most of the problems were plainly mistakes,
	  or problems that cropped up after some transformation of the
	  glyph. Others seem to be the result of freehand drawing or

2008-03-01 10:20 +0000 [r521]  Stevan_White:

	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?22329 * Drew several
	  glyphs for special forms of yeh * Drew sukun combining
	  diacritical * Made some diacritical combining marks to be
	  properly zero width. * Added 'init' 'medi' 'fina' tables to
	  convert letters to their initial, medial, and final forms within
	  words. * Added 'rlig' table for required ligatures of lam and
	  alif * Constructed the lam-alif ligatures. Not done: * may be
	  more required ligatures of lam and alif * other common ligatures
	  * 'mark' table for better positioning of diacriticals * 'mark'
	  table for positioning vowels * 'locl' table for localized forms
	  of certain letters * 'ccmp' table for decomposing ligatures Also
	  (nothing to do with Arabic): moved some glyphs 02d4-02D7 up.

	  #21784: missing glyphs for HTML 4 character entities
	  https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?21784 Main things remaining: do
	  similar process for bold and oblique forms. ----- notes
	  ----------- Filled out several typographic spaces in Sans and
	  Mono U+2000, etc. Mono made Rfraktur Mono made 'angle' Mono
	  copied cards suites from FreeSerif and scaled to fit Sans drew
	  upsilon-hook. Sans constructed omegapi from omega and a minus
	  Sans made overline Sans flat copied cards suites from FreeSerif
	  (maybe not "sans" enough?) Sans 'similar' didn't look like other
	  such symbols and was much skinnier Sans made several symbols to
	  be references to 'similar' Sans made 'congruent' Sans made
	  reference to aleph from alephmath Sans angleleft and angleright
	  brackets just copied from Serif (in which they look too angular)
	  Sans "subset" is too high and looks like a letter C. Made to be a
	  tad higher than small letter Sans notin doesn't look like isin:
	  'element' 2208 is the height of a capital. Fixed this, and used
	  references to better effect. Sans weierstrass p: copied from Mono
	  (where its style doesn't fit anyway), and widened the stroke
	  -------- other notes ----------------- better check Sans 0361
	  also doubt 223E is right What is to be done about that? Serif
	  2040 tie is low...didn't I fix this? Sans Rfraktur and Ifraktur
	  are not sans-serif. Overall, many Sans math symbols are much
	  thinner than seems to fit. Sans surprises me not all the
	  "equals"-like characters are made from "minus" Sans "period" is a
	  square. (Don't like the dot operator being a square, but that
	  would be consistent.) Serif ceil and floor glyphs are not high
	  enough

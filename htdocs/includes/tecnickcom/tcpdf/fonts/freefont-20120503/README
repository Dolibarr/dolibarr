                          GNU FreeFont

The GNU FreeFont project aims to provide a useful set of free scalable
(i.e., OpenType) fonts covering as much as possible of the ISO 10646/Unicode
UCS (Universal Character Set).

Statement of Purpose
--------------------

The practical reason for putting glyphs together in a single font face is
to conveniently mix symbols and characters from different writing systems,
without having to switch fonts.

Coverage
--------

FreeFont covers the following character ranges
* Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic, with supplements for many languages
* Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Thaana, Syriac
* Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Sinhala, Tamil, Malayalam
* Thai, Tai Le, Kayah Li, Hanun√≥o, Buginese
* Cherokee, Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics
* Ethiopian, Tifnagh, Vai, Osmanya, Coptic
* Glagolitic, Gothic, Runic, Ugaritic, Old Persian, Phoenician, Old Italic
* Braille, International Phonetic Alphabet
* currency symbols, general punctuation and diacritical marks, dingbats
* mathematical symbols, including much of the TeX repertoire of symbols
* technical symbols: APL, OCR, arrows,
* geometrical shapes, box drawing
* musical symbols, gaming symbols, miscellaneous symbols
  etc.

Editing
-------

The free outline font editor, George Williams' FontForge
<http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/> is used for editing the fonts.

Design Issues
-------------

Which font shapes should be made?  Historical style terms like Renaissance
or Baroque letterforms cannot be applied beyond Latin/Cyrillic/Greek
scripts to any greater extent than Kufi or Nashki can be applied beyond
Arabic script; "italic" is strictly meaningful only for Latin letters, 
although many scripts such as Cyrillic have a history with "cursive" and
many others with "oblique" faces. 

However, most modern writing systems have typographic formulations for
contrasting uniform and modulated character stroke widths, and since the
advent of the typewriter, most have developed a typographic style with
uniform-width characters.

Accordingly, the FreeFont family has one monospaced - FreeMono - and two
proportional faces (one with uniform stroke - FreeSans - and one with
modulated stroke - FreeSerif).

The point of having characters from different writing systems in one font
is that mixed text should look good, and so each FreeFont face contains
characters of similar style and weight.

Files and their suffixes
------------------------

The files with .sfd (Spline Font Database) are in FontForge's native format. 
They may be used to modify the fonts.

TrueType fonts are the files with the .ttf (TrueType Font) suffix.  These
are ready to use in Linux/Unix, on Apple Mac OS, and on Microsoft Windows
systems.

OpenType fonts (with suffix .otf) are preferred for use on Linux/Unix,
but *not* for recent Microsoft Windows systems.
See the INSTALL file for more information.

Web Open Font Format files (with suffix .woff) are for use in Web sites.
See the webfont_guidelines.txt for further information.

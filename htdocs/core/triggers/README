Directory content
--------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains all available Dolibarr triggers.

Trigger file name syntax is:
> interface_modModule_Mytrigger.php[-NORUN]

where:
> modModule is part of module descriptor file name found in core/modules
            directory or value 'all' if not enabled by a particular module.
> Mytrigger is name of the trigger. The PHP class inside the trigger file
            would be named InterfaceMytrigger.
> -NORUN is optional and disable completely a trigger file if set. To use 
            a trigger with such a name, rename file to remove the -NORUN part.

# The NETWORK section contains the path to a folder to ensure that requests
# to load resources will use internet. 
# CACHE has priority on NETWORK, so usage is useless
NETWORK:

# The FALLBACK section contains entries that provide a backup strategy.
# If the browser is unable to retrieve the original content, the fallback resource will be used.
# In the example above, we display a static image in case the dynamic one is unavailable.

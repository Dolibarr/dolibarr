--------------------------------
This directory contains PHP script samples that can be used to start a development on Dolibarr.


*** build_class_from_table.php:

This is the script to use to generate PHP code of a PHP POJO class
object, a PHP script that use this POJO. This script use the files
skeleton_*.php to build its generated code. 


*** modMyModule.class.php:

Is a sample of module descriptor that you can use if you want to build a new module/plugin for
Dolibarr.


*** skeleton_script.php:

Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build a script to run on command line


*** skeleton_page.php:

Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build an HTML page to include in Dolibarr GUI.


*** skeleton_class.class.php:

Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build a class file to access a new table required by a Dolibarr development.
However it is better to run the build_class_from_table.php script that accepts a table name as a parameter and will uses the description table within database and the skeleton_class.class.php file to generate full code for your class file.
After running this script, the class to access your table (insert a record, update, delete and select) is directly finished and can be used by your module's code. 
No more coding is needed to get access to table with this script because the file is completely generated once.

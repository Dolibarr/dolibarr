# Git hooks

Optional [GIT hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) are provided.
These are just wrappers calling composer scripts.  
They ensure best practices are followed during module development.  

Install:
```sh
composer git_hooks_install
```

Remove:
```sh
composer git_hooks_remove
```

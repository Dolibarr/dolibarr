=== Definitions [[definitions]]

To understand the descriptions of the target process, it was necessary to define or redefine some vocabulary concepts. We must see these definitions as defined in the
new system. Indeed, some terms are already being used but have either not a definition in line with standards, or even differs between services. To bring everyone, 
and to consolidate the process, these terms are redefined here, and with their definition in the target objective.

== BUSINESS SPECIFICATION - PROCESS

Specifications were cut into different business process. We call a business process a workflow with a starting situation and ending situation. Between start and end, we will find actions
done by actors to bring the value of the company. This actions are described using the syntax rule:
*Actor X* do action Y, *Actor Z* do action W.

_Each process/use case is described into a separate chapter._

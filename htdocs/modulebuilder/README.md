Module Builder
==============

This is a module to provide embedded tools to develop your own application/features inside Dolibarr ERP CRM software.
It provides tools for module developers to kickstart their project and give an hands-on sample of which features Dolibarr
has to offer for module development.

If you don't need to develop your own module/application, you just don't need this.

After enabling this module, you should find features to generate or edit modules/application from menu *Home - Tools - Module builder*

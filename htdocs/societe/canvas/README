This directory contains an example on how we can use
the canvas feature to overwrite the thirdparty screen and
sql code by new one.

This directory is used only if thirdpartie's pages are called
with option canvas=newcanvas@societe parameter.
If yes, screens are replaced by template in
htdocs/societe/canvas/newcanvas directory
and actions are also replaced by actions in
htdocs/societe/canvas/newcanvas directory.

In standard usage of Dolibarr, this directory can be removed.

GenericMaskCodes=You may enter any numbering mask. In this mask, the following tags could be used:<br><b>{000000}</b> corresponds to a number which will be incremented on each %s. Enter as many zeros to the desired length of the counter. The counter will be completed by zeros from the left in order to have as many zeros as the mask. <br><b>{000000+000}</b> same as previous but an offset corresponding to the number to the right of the + sign is applied starting on first %s. <br><b>{000000@x}</b> same as previous but the counter is reset to zero when month x is reached (x between 1 and 12, or 0 to use the early months of fiscal year defined in your configuration, or 99 to reset to zero every month). If this option is used and x is 2 or higher, then sequence {yy}{mm} or {yyyy}{mm} is also required. <br><b>{dd}</b> day (01 to 31).<br><b>{mm}</b> month (01 to 12).<br><b>{yy}</b>, <b>{yyyy}</b> or <b>{y}</b> year over 2, 4 or 1 numbers. <br>

This counter dedicated per customer is reset at same time as the global counter.<br><b>{tttt}</b> The code of third party type of n characters (see menu Home - Setup - Dictionary - Types of third parties). If you add this tag, the counter will be different for each type of third party.<br>

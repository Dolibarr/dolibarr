WarningPHPMail=WARNING: It is often better to setup outgoing emails to use the email server of your provider instead of the default setup. Some email providers (like Yahoo) does not allow you to send an email from another server than their own server. Your current setup use the server of the application to send email and not the server of your email provider, so some recipients (the one compatible with the restrictive DMARC protocol), will ask your email provider if they can accept your email and some email providers (like Yahoo) may respond "no" because the server is not a server of them, so few of your sent Emails may not be accepted (be carefull also to your email provider sending quota).<br>If your Email provider (like Yahoo) has this restriction, you must change Email setup to choose the other method "SMTP server" and enter the SMTP server and credentials provided by your Email provider (ask your EMail provider to get SMTP credentials for your account).

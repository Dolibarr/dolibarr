BlockedLog=Değiştirilemez Günlükler
Field=Alan
BlockedLogDesc=This module tracks some events into an unalterable log (that you can't modify once recorded) into a block chain, in real time. This module provides compatibility with requirements of laws of some countries (like France with the law Finance 2016 - Norme NF525).
Fingerprints=Archived events and fingerprints
FingerprintsDesc=This is the tool to browse or extract the unalterable logs. Unalterable logs are generated and archived locally into a dedicated table, in real time when you record a business event. You can use this tool to export this archive and save it into an external support (some countries, like France, ask that you do it every year). Note that, there is no feature to purge this log and every change tried to be done directly into this log (by a hacker for example) will be reported with a non-valid fingerprint. If you really need to purge this table because you used your application for a demo/test purpose and want to clean your data to start your production, you can ask your reseller or integrator to reset your database (all your data will be removed).

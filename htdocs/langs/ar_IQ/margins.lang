ForceBuyingPriceIfNullDetails=If buying/cost price not provided when we add a new line, and this option is "ON", the margin will be 0 on the new line (buying/cost price = selling price). If this option is "OFF" (recommended), margin will be equal to the value suggested by default (and may be 100% if no default value can be found).

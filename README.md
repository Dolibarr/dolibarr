## INSTALLING

### Simple setup

If you have low technical skills and you're looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in just a few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:

- [DoliWamp for Windows](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Windows_(DoliWamp)
- [DoliDeb for Debian](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Ubuntu_or_Debian
- DoliRpm for Redhat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia

Releases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).

### Advanced setup

You can use a Web server and a supported database (MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL) to install the standard version.

- Check that your installed PHP version is supported [see PHP support](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Versions).

- Uncompress the downloaded .zip archive to copy the "dolibarr/htdocs" directory and all its files inside your web server root or get the files directly from GitHub (recommanded if you known git):

  `git clone https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr -b x.y`     (where x.y is main version like 3.6, 9.0, ...)

- Set up your web server to use "*dolibarr/htdocs*" as root if your web server does not have an already defined directory to point to.

- Create an empty `htdocs/conf/conf.php` file and set *write* permissions for your web server user (*write* permission will be removed once install is finished)

- From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page

  The URL will depends on how you web setup was setup to point to your dolibarr installation. It may looks like:

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/`

  or

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/install/`

  or

  `http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/`

- Follow the installer instructions

### Saas/Cloud setup

If you don't have time to install it yourself, you can try some commercial 'ready to use' Cloud offers (See https://saas.dolibarr.org). However, this third solution is not free.


## UPGRADING

- At first make a backup of your Dolibarr files & than see https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Installation_-_Upgrade#Upgrade_Dolibarr
- Check that your installed PHP version is supported by the new version [see PHP support](./doc/phpmatrix.md).
- Overwrite all old files from 'dolibarr' directory with files provided into the new version's package.
- At first next access, Dolibarr will redirect your to the "install/" page to follow the upgrade process.
 ¬†If an `install.lock` file exists to lock any other upgrade process, the application will ask you to remove the file manually (you should find the `install.lock` file into the directory used to store generated and uploaded documents, in most cases, it is the directory called "*documents*").

*Note: migration process can be safely done multiple times by calling the `/install/index.php` page*

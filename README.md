## INSTALLING

### Download

Releases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).

### Simple setup

If you have low technical skills and you're looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:

- DoliWamp for Windows
- DoliDeb for Debian or Ubuntu
- DoliRpm for Redhat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia

### Advanced setup

You can use a Web server and a supported database (MySQL recommended) to install the standard version.

- Uncompress the downloaded archive
- Copy directory "dolibarr" and all its files inside your web server root, or copy directory anywhere and set up your web server to use "dolibarr/htdocs" as root for a new web server virtual host (second choice need to be server administrator)
- Create an empty file "htdocs/conf/conf.php" and set permissions for your web server user (write permissions will be removed once install is finished)
- From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page

    The URL will depends on choices made in the first step:

        http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/
        
    or
    
        http://localhost/dolibarr/install/
        
    or
    
    	http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/
   
- Follow the installer instructions

## UPGRADING

- Overwrite all old files from 'dolibarr' directory with files provided into the new version's package.
- If you're upgrading from version x.y.z to x.y.w (only third number differs), there is no need to run any migration process.
- If you're upgrading from a beta version or from any version x.y.z to any other where x or y number differs, you must call the Dolibarr "install/" page in your browser (this should be done automatically at first dolibarr access) and follow the upgrade process.

*Note: migration process can safely be done multiple times.*

## INSTALLING

### Simple setup

If you have low technical skills and you're looking to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in just a few clicks, you can use one of the packaged versions:

- [DoliWamp for Windows](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Windows_DoliWamp)
- [DoliDeb for Debian](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Dolibarr_for_Ubuntu_or_Debian)
- DoliRpm for Redhat, Fedora, OpenSuse, Mandriva or Mageia

Releases can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.dolibarr.org/).

### Advanced setup

You can use a web server and a supported database (MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL) to install the standard version.

On GNU/Linux, first check if your distribution has already packaged Dolibarr.

#### Generic install steps:

- Check that your installed PHP version is supported [see PHP support](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Releases).

- Uncompress the downloaded .zip archive to copy the "dolibarr/htdocs" directory and all its files inside your web server root or get the files directly from GitHub (recommanded if you know git as it makes it easier if you want to upgrade later):

  `git clone https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr -b x.y`     (where x.y is main version like 3.6, 9.0, ...)

- Set up your web server to use "*dolibarr/htdocs*" as root if your web server does not have an already defined directory to point to.

- Create an empty `htdocs/conf/conf.php` file and set *write* permissions for your web server user (*write* permission will be removed once install is finished)

- From your browser, go to the dolibarr "install/" page

  The URL will depends on how you web setup was setup to point to your dolibarr installation. It may looks like:

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/`

  or

  `http://localhost/dolibarr/install/`

  or

  `http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/`

- Follow the installer instructions

### Saas/Cloud setup

If you don't have time to install it yourself, you can try some commercial 'ready to use' Cloud offers (See https://saas.dolibarr.org). However, this third solution is not free.


## UPGRADING

Dolibarr supports upgrading usually wihtout the need for any (commercial) support (depending on if you use any commercial extensions) and supports upgrading all the way from any version after 2.8 without breakage. This is unique in the ERP ecosystem and a benefit our users highly appreciate!
 
- At first make a backup of your Dolibarr files & than [see](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php/Installation_-_Upgrade#Upgrade_Dolibarr)
- Check that your installed PHP version is supported by the new version [see PHP support](./doc/phpmatrix.md).
- Overwrite all old files from 'dolibarr' directory with files provided into the new version's package.
- At first next access, Dolibarr will redirect you to the "install/" page to follow the upgrade process.
 ¬†If an `install.lock` file exists to lock any other upgrade process, the application will ask you to remove the file manually (you should find the `install.lock` file in the directory used to store generated and uploaded documents, in most cases, it is the directory called "*documents*").

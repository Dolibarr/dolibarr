Building a Patch file
##################################################

This directory contains tools to build a patch after a developer has made changes on files in its Dolibarr tree. 
The output patch file can then be submitted on Dolibarr dev mailing-list, with explanation on its goal, for inclusion in main branch.

Using this tool is now deprecated. You must use git pull requests to submit contributions.

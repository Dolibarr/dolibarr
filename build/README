Building packages
##################################################

All sub-directories of "build" directory contains files (setup or binary tools) required to build automatically Dolibarr packages.
There are several tools:



- To build full Dolibarr packages, launch the script
> Launch command perl makepack-dolibarr.pl

Note: Prerequisites to build tgz, debian, rpm package
> apt-get install tar dpkg dpatch p7zip-full rpm zip

Note: Prerequisites to build autoexe DoliWamp package:
> apt-get install wine q4wine
> Launch "wine cmd" to check a drive Z: pointing to / exists.
> Install InnoSetup
   For example by running isetup-5.3.9.exe (http://www.jrsoftware.org)
> Install WampServer into "C:\wamp64" to have Apache, PHP and MariaDB
   For example by running wampserver3.2.0_x64.exe (http://www.wampserver.com). See file build/exe/doliwamp.iss to know the doliwamp version currently setup.
> Add path to ISCC into PATH windows var:
  Launch wine cmd, then regedit and add entry int HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment\PATH
> To build manually the .exe from Windows (running from makepack-dolibarr.pl script is however recommanded), 
  open file build/exe/doliwamp.iss and click on button "Compile".
  The .exe file will be build into directory build.

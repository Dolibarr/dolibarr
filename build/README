All sub-directories of "build" directory contains files required to build
automatically Dolibarr packages.
There are several tools:



- To build full Dolibarr packages, launch the script
> Launch command perl makepack-dolibarr.pl

Note: Prerequisites to build tgz, debian, rpm package
> apt-get install tar dpkg dpatch p7zip-full rpm zip

Note: Prerequisites to build autoexe DoliWamp package:
> apt-get install wine q4wine
> Launch "wine cmd" to check a drive Z: pointing to / exists.
> Install InnoSetup
   For example by running isetup-5.3.9.exe (http://www.jrsoftware.org)
> Install WampServer into "C:\Program Files\Wamp"
   For example by running wampserver2.5-Apache-2.4.9-Mysql-5.6.17-php5.5.12-32b.exe (http://www.wampserver.com)
> Install WampServer addon to have versions: Mysql5.0.45
   For example by running WampServer2-MYSQL5045.exe (http://www.wampserver.com)
> To build from Windows (running from makepack-dolibarr.pl script is however
  recommanded), open file build/exe/doliwamp.iss and click on button "Compile".
  The .exe file will be build into directory build.

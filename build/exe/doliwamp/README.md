# DOLIWAMP, THE DOLIBARR INSTALLER FOR WINDOWS

DoliWamp is a special all in one package installer for Windows (Dolibarr+Mysql+Apache+PHP). 
It's a dedicated Dolibarr version for Windows newbies with no technical knowledge. This package will install or upgrade Dolibarr but also all prerequisites like the web server, and the database in one auto-install process.

This directory contains files used by *makepack-dolibarr.pl* script to build the all-in-on .EXE package DoliWamp, ready
to be distributed (for Windows).
The build of .exe files need to have some windows executable files already installed (Apache, MariaDb). The package to install to get this files are defined into the file *doliwamp.iss* (searhc line starting with "; Value OK:")

If you have technical knowledge in web administration and plan to share your server instance (Apache, Mysql or PHP) with other projects than Dolibarr or want to use Dolibarr other components (PostgreSQL), you should not use this assistant and make a manual installation of Dolibarr on your existing server by downloading the standard package (.tgz or .zip file).

Comment:
 Sources for all minified javascript libraries are available in same directory
 than minified version (.min.js), except for ckeditor whose sources are files
 ckeditor_basic_source.js, ckeditor_source.js and files into directory _source.
 Those files are not shipped in the binary package since we use the
 library as packaged in "ckeditor".

Comment:
 JQuery itself is not shipped in the binary package, instead Dolibarr is
 configured to use the packaged version from "libjs-jquery" and
 "libjs-jquery-ui". Most of the plugins are shipped though.

In this directory you find some examples of deploy procedures
for general purposes deploys (single wars, single files, tarballs, list
of files from a list...) described in a single define.

They are made in order to be generic enough to adapt to different 
environments and scenarious but you might need to design your
own deployment process.

In order to do that you can create a new define that includes:
- All the variables, required or optional, you may want
- One puppi:project statement 
- All the puppi::deploy statements you need (each one runs a command)
- All the puppi::rollback statements you need
- One or more puppi::report statements for reporting

The examples provided here make use of the scripts provided in
puppi/files/scripts and tend to split the deploy procedures in many 
different, reusable, scripts (one gets the source file(s), another 
archives the current content, another one actually copies the files
to deploy and so on) but you can use just a single new script or 
whatever combination you might prefer.

The default puppi scripts and the general ordering of commands
execution in these sample deploy defines follow this scheme:
Priority - Kind of operations
1x - Pre Deploy checks 
2x - Files retrieving and preparation
3x - Operations to accomplish before the deploy (Archiving, Services stopping..)
40 - Deploy.sh - The script that actually copied the files on deploy dir
4x - Operations to accomplish after the deploy (Services start...)
8x - Post Deploy checks

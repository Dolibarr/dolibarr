##Overview

This module manages RabbitMQ (www.rabbitmq.com)

##Module Description
The rabbitmq module sets up rabbitmq and has a number of providers to manage
everything from vhosts to exchanges after setup.

This module has been tested against 2.7.1 and is known to not support
all features against earlier versions.

##Setup

###What rabbitmq affects

* rabbitmq repository files.
* rabbitmq package.
* rabbitmq configuration file.
* rabbitmq service.

###Beginning with rabbitmq

```puppet
include '::rabbitmq'
```

##Usage

All options and configuration can be done through interacting with the parameters
on the main rabbitmq class.  These are documented below.

##rabbitmq class

To begin with the rabbitmq class controls the installation of rabbitmq.  In here
you can control many parameters relating to the package and service, such as
disabling puppet support of the service:

```puppet
class { '::rabbitmq':
  service_manage    => false,
  port              => '5672',
  delete_guest_user => true,
}
```

### Environment Variables
To use RabbitMQ Environment Variables, use the parameters `environment_variables` e.g.:

```puppet
class { 'rabbitmq':
  port              => '5672',
  environment_variables   => {
    'RABBITMQ_NODENAME'     => 'node01',
    'RABBITMQ_SERVICENAME'  => 'RabbitMQ'
  }
}
```

### Variables Configurable in rabbitmq.config
To change RabbitMQ Config Variables in rabbitmq.config, use the parameters `config_variables` e.g.:

```puppet
class { 'rabbitmq':
  port              => '5672',
  config_variables   => {
    'hipe_compile'  => true,
    'frame_max'     => 131072,
    'log_levels'    => "[{connection, info}]"
  }
}
```

To change Erlang Kernel Config Variables in rabbitmq.config, use the parameters
`config_kernel_variables` e.g.:

```puppet
class { 'rabbitmq':
  port              => '5672',
  config_kernel_variables  => {
    'inet_dist_listen_min' => 9100,
    'inet_dist_listen_max' => 9105,
  }
}
```

### Clustering
To use RabbitMQ clustering facilities, use the rabbitmq parameters
`config_cluster`, `cluster_nodes`, and `cluster_node_type`, e.g.:

```puppet
class { 'rabbitmq':
  config_cluster    => true,
  cluster_nodes     => ['rabbit1', 'rabbit2'],
  cluster_node_type => 'ram',
}
```

**NOTE:** If you are using a version of RabbitMQ less than 3.0,
you still need to use `x-ha-policy: all` in your client
applications for any particular queue to take advantage of H/A via
mirrored queues.

If you are using a version of RabbitMQ >= 3.0 You should set the
'config_mirrored_queues' parameter if you plan
on using RabbitMQ Mirrored Queues within your cluster:

```puppet
class { 'rabbitmq':
  config_cluster         => true,
  config_mirrored_queues => true,
  cluster_nodes          => ['rabbit1', 'rabbit2'],
}
```

Optional parameter tags will set further rabbitmq tags like monitoring, policymaker, etc.
To set the administrator tag use admin-flag.

rabbitmq_exchange { 'myexchange@myhost':
  user     => 'dan',
  password => 'bar',
  type     => 'topic',
  ensure   => present,

##Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 2.7 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6
* Debian 6/7
* CentOS 5/6
* Ubuntu 12.04

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed.

### Module dependencies
To have a suitable erlang version installed on RedHat and Debian systems,
you have to install another puppet module from http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/erlang with:

    puppet module install garethr-erlang

This module handles the packages for erlang.
To use the module, add the following snippet to your site.pp or an appropriate profile class:

For RedHat systems:

    include 'erlang'
    class { 'erlang': epel_enable => true}

For Debian systems:

    include 'erlang'
    package { 'erlang-base':
      ensure => 'latest',
    }

##Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community
contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the
huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment
configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)

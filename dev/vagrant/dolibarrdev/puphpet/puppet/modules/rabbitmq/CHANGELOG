2014-05-16 - Version 4.0.0

Summary:

This release includes many new features and bug fixes.  With the exception of
erlang management this should be backwards compatible with 3.1.0.

- Allow empty permission fields
- Convert existing system tests to beaker acceptance tests.

Bugfixes:
- exchanges no longer recreated on each puppet run if non-default vhost is used
- Allow port to be UNSET
- Re-added rabbitmq::server class
- Deprecated previously unused manage_service variable in favor of 
  service_manage
- Use correct key for rabbitmq apt::source
- config_mirrored_queues variable removed
  - It previously did nothing, will now at least throw a warning if you try to
    use it
- Remove unnecessary dependency on Class['rabbitmq::repo::rhel'] in
  rabbitmq::install


2013-09-14 - Version 3.1.0

Summary:

This release focuses on a few small (but critical) bugfixes as well as extends
the amount of custom RabbitMQ configuration you can do with the module.

Features:
- You can now change RabbitMQ 'Config Variables' via the parameter `config_variables`.
- You can now change RabbitMQ 'Environment Variables' via the parameter `environment_variables`.
- ArchLinux support added.

Fixes:
- Make use of the user/password parameters in rabbitmq_exchange{}
- Correct the read/write parameter order on set_permissions/list_permissions as
  they were reversed.
- Make the module pull down 3.1.5 by default.

* 2013-07-18 3.0.0
Summary:
This release heavily refactors the RabbitMQ and changes functionality in
several key ways.  Please pay attention to the new README.md file for
details of how to interact with the class now.  Puppet 3 and RHEL are
now fully supported.  The default version of RabbitMQ has changed to
a 3.x release.

Bugfixes:
- Improve travis testing options.
- Stop reimporting the GPG key on every run on RHEL and Debian.
- Fix documentation to make it clear you don't have to set provider => each time.
- Reference the standard rabbitmq port in the documentation instead of a custom port.
- Fixes to the README formatting.

Features:
- Refactor the module to fix RHEL support.  All interaction with the module
is now done through the main rabbitmq class.
- Add support for mirrored queues (Only on Debian family distributions currently)
- Add rabbitmq_exchange provider (using rabbitmqadmin)
- Add new `rabbitmq` class parameters:
  - `manage_service`: Boolean to choose if Puppet should manage the service. (For pacemaker/HA setups)
- Add SuSE support.

Incompatible Changes:
- Rabbitmq::server has been removed and is now rabbitmq::config.  You should
not use this class directly, only via the main rabbitmq class.

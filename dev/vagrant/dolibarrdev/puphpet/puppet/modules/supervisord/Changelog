2014-06-20 - v0.4.0

Fixes:

- Removed root as group and replaced with uid 0 to enhance system
compatibility

Enhancements:

- Made package provider a user definable param see supervisord::package_provider and README for details of how to change this.
- All define types can now be automatically pulled in from hiera see example https://github.com/ajcrowe/puppet-supervisord#configure-a-program
- You can now override the default include path of $config_include/*.conf with your own array using $config_dirs. Bear in mind this would need to include whatever you set $config_include to be, with *.conf on the end.

Many thanks for the PRs from @jasperla, @mvantellingen for the bug report on the service name and @hasc for the enhancement ideas.

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions
are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and
myriad of hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work
in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so
that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)

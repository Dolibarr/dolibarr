Read me for some important information!

If Puppet did not blow up (you do not see a sea of red above), then your VM
was generated successfully!

* A unique private key was generated for you! It is located at
  "puphpet/files/dot/ssh/id_rsa". If you are on Windows, a PuTTY-friendly key
  was also generated at same location with a ".ppk" extension.
* If you want to use your own private key for future provisions, overwrite the
  generated key above with your own. Make sure to follow the naming pattern,
  and include a ".pub" public key.
* If you wish to add packages, modules, Apache/Nginx vhosts, or anything else,
  open up "puphpet/config.yaml" and make changes within! Some things will
  have random strings like "DIdXRs2OI2LJ" - you must create a random string
  as well! To do so, please apply face to keyboard and roll.
* If you change "puphpet/config.yaml", simple run "$ vagrant provision" and
  your VM will be updated with the changes you requested!

Did something go wrong? Don't worry! I can (maybe) help! Please go to our
Github issues page at https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/issues and search for
your problem. If you do not find your problem answered, open a new ticket!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THE CONTENTS OF YOUR "puphpet/config.yaml" FILE.

Make sure to xxx out any potential API keys or passwords that you do not want
others to see!

Happy programming!

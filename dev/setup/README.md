# Setting up for Dolibarr development

Check out the
[online documentation](https://wiki.dolibarr.org/index.php?title=Environment_and_development_tools)
for recommendations (to be updated).

If anything, install `pre-commit` - it will help run the tools to format and
make some basic verifications on your submission before committing and pushing
to github for a PR. See [a quick start guide](./pre-commit/README.md) in this
Dolibarr repository.

--------------------------------
This directory contains PHP script samples that can be used to start a development on Dolibarr.


modMyModule.class.php:
Is a sample of module descriptor you can use if you want to build a new module/plugin for
Dolibarr.
 
skeleton_script.php:
Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build a script to run on command line

skeleton_page.php:
Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build an HTML page to include in Dolibarr GUI.

skeleton_class.class.php:
Is a sample you can use as an example if you need to build a class file to access a new table
required by a Dolibarr development.
However it is better to run the script build_class_from_table.php that accept a table name as a 
parameter and will used table description in database and the skeleton_class.class.php file to
generate full code for your class file.
After running this script, the class to access your table (insert a record, update, delete and select)
is directly finished and can be used by your business code. No more coding for accesser on table
is needed with this script as the file is completely generated once.

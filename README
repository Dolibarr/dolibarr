I - DOLIBARR INSTALL
--------------------

If you have no technical knowledge, and you are looking for an autoinstaller
to install Dolibarr ERP/CRM in few clicks, you must download DoliWamp (the 
all-in-one package of Dolibarr for Windows), DoliDeb (the all-in-one package 
of Dolibarr for Debian or Ubuntu) or DoliRpm (the all-in-one package of 
Dolibarr for Fedora, Redhat, Mandriva, Opensue, Mageia).

You can download this at:
http://www.dolibarr.org/downloads/

If you already have installed a Web server and a Mysql database, you can
install the standard version like this:

- Uncompress the downloaded archive.
 
- Copy directory "dolibarr" and all its files inside your web server root,
  or copy directory anywhere and set up your web server to use "dolibarr/htdocs"
  as root for a new web server virtual host (second choice need to be web 
  server administrator).
  
- Create an empty file "htdocs/conf/conf.php" and set permissions for your web
  server user (write permissions will be removed once install is finished).
  
- From your browser, call the dolibarr "install/" page. Url depends on choice
  made on first step:
   http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/
  or
   http://yourdolibarrvirtualhost/install/
   
- Follow instructions provided by installer...



II - DOLIBARR UPGRADE
---------------------

To upgrade Dolibarr from an old version to this one:

- Overwrite all old files inside old 'dolibarr' directory by files
  provided into new version package.
  
- If you came from version x.y.z to x.y.w (only third number differ),
  there is no need to run any migrate process.
  
- If you came from a beta version or from any version x.y.z to any
  other where x or y number differs, you must call the Dolibarr "install/"
  page in your browser (this should be done automatically at first dolibarr
  access).
  This URL should looks like:
   http://localhost/dolibarr/htdocs/install/
  or
   http://yourdolibarrhost/install/index.php

  Then choose the "update" option according to your case.
  Note: Migrate process can be ran safely several times.

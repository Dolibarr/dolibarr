# Security Policy

This file contains some policies about the security reports on Dolibarr ERP CRM project, one of the most popular Open Source ERP and CRM in the world.

## Supported Versions for security reports

Security report are valid only on current stable version (see https://dolibarr.org web site to get current stable version) or on development version (branch "develop" on https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, for a private report, you can:

- Send your report on [https://app.yogosha.com/cvd/dolibarr/10VxeNx6Ui3rSEhAgX63US](https://app.yogosha.com/cvd/dolibarr/10VxeNx6Ui3rSEhAgX63US) (recommended for everybody)
- Or if you have permissions, use GitHub security advisory at [https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/security/advisories/new)
- Or send by email to security@dolibarr.org a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the issue, include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary

## Hunting vulnerabilities on Dolibarr

We believe that the future of software is online SaaS. This means software are more and more critical and no technology is perfect. Working with skilled security researchers is crucial in identifying weaknesses in our technology.

If you believe you've found a security bug in our service, we are happy to work with you to resolve the issue promptly and ensure you are fairly rewarded for your discovery.

Any type of denial-of-service attack is strictly forbidden, as well as any interference with network equipment and Dolibarr infrastructure.

We recommend to install Dolibarr ERP CRM on your own server (as most Open Source software, download and use is free: [https://www.dolibarr.org/download](https://www.dolibarr.org/download)) to get access on every side of application.

### User Agent

If you try to find bug on Dolibarr, we recommend to append to your user-agent header the following value: '-securitytest-for-dolibarr'.

### Account access

You can install the web application yourself on your own platform/server so you get full access to application and sources. Download the zip of the files to put in your own web server virtual host from [https://www.dolibarr.org/download](https://www.dolibarr.org/download)

## Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure

We are happy to thank everyone who submits valid reports which help us improve the security of Dolibarr, however only those that meet the following eligibility requirements will be "validated reports" (if not, we may close the report without any answer):

You must be the first reporter of the vulnerability (duplicate reports are closed).

You must avoid tests that could cause degradation or interruption of our service (refrain from using automated tools, and limit yourself about requests per second), that's why we recommend to install software on your own platform.

You must not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data of third parties to find your vulnerability.

Reports are processed around once a month.

## Scope for qualified vulnerabilities

ONLY vulnerabilities discovered, when the following setup on test platform is used, are "valid":

* The version to analyze must be the last version available in the "develop" branch. Reports on vulnerabilities already fixed (so already reported) in the develop branch will not be validated.   
* $dolibarr_main_prod must be set to 1 in conf.php
* $dolibarr_nocsrfcheck must be kept to the value 0 in conf.php (this is the default value)
* $dolibarr_main_force_https must be set to something else than 0.
* Some constant must be set in the backoffice menu Home - Setup - Other
  - MAIN_SECURITY_CSRF_WITH_TOKEN must be set to 3 
  - MAIN_RESTRICTHTML_ONLY_VALID_HTML = 1
  - MAIN_RESTRICTHTML_ONLY_VALID_HTML_TIDY = 1
  - MAIN_RESTRICTHTML_REMOVE_ALSO_BAD_ATTRIBUTES = 1 
  CSRF attacks and HTML injections are accepted but double check this setup that is experimental setup that already fix a lot of case and soon enabled by default.
* ONLY security reports on modules provided by default and with the "stable" status are valid (troubles in "experimental", "development" or external modules are not valid vulnerabilities).
* The root of web server must link to htdocs and the documents directory must be outside of the web server root (this is the default when using the default installer but may differs with external installer).
* The web server setup must be done so that only the documents directory is in write mode. The root directory called htdocs must be read-only.
* The modules DebugBar and ModuleBuilder must NOT be enabled. (by default, these modules are not enabled. They are developer tools)
* Ability for a high-level user to edit web site pages in the CMS by including HTML or JavaScript is an expected feature. Vulnerabilities in the website module are validated only if HTML or JavaScript injection can be done by a non-allowed user.
* Fail2ban rules for rate limit on the login page, forgotten password page, API calls and all public pages (/public/*) must be installed as recommended in the section "About - Admin tools - Section Access limits and mitigation".

Scope is the web application (backoffice) and the APIs.

## Examples of vulnerabilities that are Qualified for reporting.

* Remote code execution (RCE)
* Local files access and manipulation (LFI, RFI, XXE, SSRF, XSPA)
* Code injections (JS, SQL, PHP). HTML are covered only for fields that are not description, notes or comments fields (where rich content is allowed on purpose).
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), except from setup page of module "External web site" (allowing any content here, editable by admin user only, is accepted on purpose) and except in the module "Web site" when permission to edit website content is allowed (injecting any data in this case is allowed too).
* Cross-Site Requests Forgery (CSRF) with real security impact (when using GET URLs, CSRF are qualified only for creating, updating or deleting data from pages restricted to admin users)
* Open redirect
* Broken authentication & session management
* Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with real security impact
* Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation
* "HTTP Host Header" XSS
* Software version disclosure (for non-admin users only)
* Stack traces or path disclosure (for non-admin users only)

## Examples of vulnerabilities that are Non-qualified for reporting.

* "Self" XSS
* Clickjacking/UI redressing
* Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms
* Logout and other instances of low-severity Cross-Site Request Forgery
* Reports from automated web vulnerability scanners (Acunetix, Vega, etc.) that have not been validated
* Reports on features on modules flagged as "deprecated", "experimental" or "development" if the module needs to be enabled for that (this is not the case on production).
* Software or libraries versions, private IP disclosure, Stack traces or path disclosure when logged-in user is admin.
* Any vulnerabilities due to a configuration different than the one defined in chapter "Scope for qualified vulnerabilities".
* Vulnerabilities affecting outdated browsers or platforms, or vulnerabilities inside browsers themself.
* Brute force attacks on login page, password forgotten page or any public pages (/public/*) are not qualified if the recommended fail2ban rules were not installed.  
* SSL/TLS best practices
* Invalid or missing SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records (Incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
* Physical or social engineering attempts or issues that require physical access to a victimâ€™s computer/device

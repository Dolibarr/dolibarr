## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to security@dolibarr.org
In most cases, after fixing the security, we make an answer by email to say the issue has been fixed.


## Hunting vulnerabilities on Dolibarr

We believe that future of software is online SaaS. This means software are more and more critical and no technology is perfect. Working with skilled security researchers is crucial in identifying weaknesses in our technology.

If you believe you've found a security bug in our service, we are happy to work with you to resolve the issue promptly and ensure you are fairly rewarded for your discovery.

Any type of denial of service attacks is strictly forbidden, as well as any interference with network equipment and Dolibarr infrastructure.

We recommand to install Dolibarr ERP CRM on you own server (as most Open Source software, download and use is free: https://www.dolibarr.org/download) to get access on every side of application.

### User Agent

If you try to find bug on Dolibarr, we recommend to append to your user-agent header the following value: '-BugHunting-dolibarr'.

### Account access

You can install the web application yourself on your own platform/server so you get full access to application and sources. Download the zip of the files to put into your own web server virtual host from https://www.dolibarr.org/download


## Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure

We are happy to thank everyone who submits valid reports which help us improve the security of Dolibarr however, only those that meet the following eligibility requirements may receive a monetary reward:

You must be the first reporter of a vulnerability.

The vulnerability must be a qualifying vulnerability (see below)

Any vulnerability found must be reported no later than 24 hours after discovery

You must send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the issue, include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.

You must avoid tests that could cause degradation or interruption of our service (refrain from using automated tools, and limit yourself about requests per second), that's why we recommand to install softwate on your own platform.

You must not leak, manipulate, or destroy any user data.

You must not be a former or current employee of Dolibarr or one of its contractor.

Reports about vulnerabilities are examined by our security analysts.

Our analysis is always based on worst case exploitation of the vulnerability, as is the reward we pay.

No vulnerability disclosure, including partial is allowed for the moment.
